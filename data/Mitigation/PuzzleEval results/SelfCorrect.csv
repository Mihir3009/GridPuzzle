"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 6** states that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.
2. **Clue 3** states that the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.
3. **Clue 2** states that the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia are consecutive in the list of vintages, with Bianca Flaux coming first.
4. **Clue 1** states that the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.
5. **Clue 5** states that the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.
6. **Clue 4** states that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.

Using the clues:
- Since the Ece Suss is after the Annata Branco and the Bianca Flaux is after the Ece Suss, the order of bottling among these three is Annata Branco, then Ece Suss, then Bianca Flaux.
- Since the Bianca Flaux is 4 years before the Vendemmia, they must be consecutive in the list of vintages.

Now, placing the wines:
- Since the Bianca Flaux is after the Ece Suss and before the Vendemmia, and considering the 4-year gap from clue 2, Bianca Flaux must be 1992 and Vendemmia must be 1996.
- Since the Ece Suss is after the Annata Branco, and the only vintage left before 1992 is 1988, the Annata Branco must be 1984 and the Ece Suss must be 1988.

Assigning types:
- Since the 1984 bottle is gewurztraminer (clue 6) and it's Annata Branco, Annata Branco is gewurztraminer.
- Since the 1988 bottle is pinot noir (clue 3) and it's Ece Suss, Ece Suss is pinot noir.
- Since the merlot is either Annata Branco or Bianca Flaux (clue 4) and Annata Branco is already gewurztraminer, Bianca Flaux must be merlot.
- The remaining type, riesling, must be for Vendemmia.

Final Answer:
1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer
1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir
1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot
1996 | Vendemmia | riesling

1. **Clue 2** states that Tracy's letter was sent in 1962. This sets the first part of our grid.

2. **Clue 5** indicates that Sean's bottle was from Le Havre. Since **Clue 4** states that Sean's missive is either from 1983 or 1962, and Tracy's letter is already in 1962, Sean's letter must be from 1983 and from Le Havre.

3. **Clue 1** states that the message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg. Since we have years 1962, 1969, 1976, and 1983 to work with, the only combination that fits is 1969 for Cherbourg and 1983 for Plymouth.

4. **Clue 3** states that the bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive. Since Tracy's letter is from 1962, Karla's bottle must be from Plymouth and sent in 1983.

5. Now, we know:

1. **Using Clue 2 and Clue 3**: Both clues indicate that the outing on April 17 was in Gilmore City where they saw 16 shooting stars.
   - 16 | April 17 | Gilmore City

2. **Using Clue 4**: The April 10 outing logged 7 more shooting stars than the April 22 outing. Since we know the numbers of shooting stars are 2, 9, 16, and 23, and 16 is already used, the only way to maintain a difference of 7 stars is if April 10 had 23 stars and April 22 had 9 stars.

3. **Using Clue 1**: Eastbrook saw 7 fewer shooting stars than Isleton. Since 16 and 23 are already used, and we need a difference of 7, the only numbers left are 2 and 9. Therefore, Eastbrook must have seen 2 stars and Isleton 9 stars.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Assigning Underwood to Room 114**: From clue 1, we know Underwood is in room 114.

2. **Determining Days for Underwood and Room 320**: Clue 2 states that the guest in room 320 stays 1 day fewer than Underwood. We need to find a suitable day for Underwood that allows another day count to be exactly one less for room 320.

3. **Assigning Days to Owens**: From clue 3, Owens is staying for 3 days. We can directly assign this.

4. **Determining Parker's Stay Relative to Room 314**: Clue 4 indicates Parker is staying 1 day longer than the guest in room 314. We need to find suitable days for room 314 that allow Parker to stay exactly one day longer.

5. **Assigning Days to Underwood and Room 320**: Since the days available are 2, 3, 4, and 5, and Owens already takes 3 days, we can test the remaining days for Underwood and room 320. If Underwood stays for 5 days, then the guest in room 320 stays for 4 days (1 day fewer than Underwood).

6. **Assigning Parker and Room 314**: Since Parker stays 1 day longer than the guest in room 314, and the only days left are 2 and 4, if we assign room 314 to stay for 2 days, Parker would then stay for 3 days. However, Owens is already staying for 3 days, so this is not possible. Therefore, room 314 must stay for 3 days, and Parker stays for 4 days.

2. From clue 4, since Stuart lost 7 lbs and the clue states that the person who lost 7 lbs is either on the caveman diet or is Raymond, and since Stuart is not Raymond, Stuart must be on the caveman diet.
3. From clue 5, Wesley lost 5 lbs.
4. From clue 1, Stuart lost 4 more pounds than the person on the vegan diet. Since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet lost 7 - 4 = 3 lbs.
5. From clue 2, the person on the gluten-free diet lost 2 more pounds than Raymond. Since the only remaining weights are 5 lbs and 9 lbs, and Wesley already lost 5 lbs, the person on the gluten-free diet must have lost 9 lbs. Therefore, Raymond must have lost 9 - 2 = 7 lbs. However, since Stuart lost 7 lbs and is not Raymond, Raymond must have lost a different amount. Revisiting the weights, since Wesley lost 5 lbs and is not on the gluten-free diet, he must be on the vegan diet (as it's the only diet left with a known weight loss of 3 lbs). Thus, the person on the gluten-free diet must be Tom, and he lost 9 lbs.
6. Since Raymond is not Stuart and Wesley is on the vegan diet, Raymond must have lost the remaining weight, which is 3 lbs. However, the diet for Raymond should be dairy-free, as it's the only diet left unassigned.

Thus, the person on the gluten-free diet must be Tom, and he lost 9 lbs.
6. Since Raymond is not Stuart and Wesley is on the vegan diet, Raymond must have lost the remaining weight, which is 3 lbs. However, the diet for Raymond should be dairy-free, as it's the only diet left unassigned.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Analyzing Clue 1**: Yvette's purchase was either the insect that sold for $45 or the peacock butterfly. This clue gives us two possibilities for Yvette's purchase.

2. **Analyzing Clue 2**: The swallowtail butterfly cost $15 more than Phillip's purchase. This clue helps us link the price of the swallowtail to Phillip's purchase.

3. **Analyzing Clue 3**: The atlas butterfly cost more than the peacock butterfly. This clue establishes a price hierarchy between the atlas and the peacock butterflies.

4. **Analyzing Clue 4**: The four butterflies were the butterfly that sold for $90, the grayling butterfly, Yvette's purchase, and Walter's purchase. This clue helps us identify the specific butterflies and their associated prices and buyers.

**Assigning Prices and Butterflies**:
- Since the swallowtail costs $15 more than Phillip's purchase, and we know one butterfly costs $90, we can deduce that Phillip's purchase must be $75 (since $90 - $15 = $75). However, we need to check if this fits with other clues.

- If Phillip's purchase is $75, then the swallowtail must be $90. This fits with Clue 4, where one butterfly sold for $90.

- From Clue 1, if Yvette's purchase was either $45 or the peacock, and since the swallowtail is $90, Yvette did not buy the swallowtail. If we assign the peacock to Yvette, we need to determine its price. Since the atlas costs more than the peacock, the peacock cannot be the most expensive. Thus, we can assign the peacock to Yvette at $75.

- With the peacock assigned to Yvette at $75, the remaining prices are $45 and $60. Since the atlas costs more than the peacock, it must be $90, which fits Walter's purchase (from Clue 4).

- The remaining butterfly, the grayling, must then be $45, and since Otis is the only buyer left, he must have bought the grayling.

Final Answer:
$45 | Otis | grayling
$60 | Phillip | swallowtail
$75 | Yvette | peacock

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Assign Eugene to Farley based on Clue 3.**
Eugene departs from Farley.

**Step 2: Determine the dates for Farley and Hardwick using Clue 1.**
Since the person from Farley leaves 2 days before the person from Hardwick, and knowing Eugene is at Farley, we need to find a suitable date for Eugene that allows a 2-day gap. If Eugene (Farley) is on June 11, then Hardwick must be on June 13.

**Step 3: Assign Mitchell and Roderick using Clue 4 and Clue 2.**
Clue 4 states that the conductor departing from Epworth will leave 1 day after Mitchell. If Mitchell is on June 12, then Epworth must be on June 13. Since Hardwick is already assigned to June 13, Mitchell cannot be on June 12. Thus, Mitchell must be on June 10, and Epworth on June 11.

**Step 4: Assign Roderick using Clue 2 and the remaining options.**
Since Mitchell is on June 10 and Eugene is on June 11, Roderick must be on June 13 (the only remaining day).

**Step 5: Assign Allen to the remaining slot.**
Allen is the only conductor left, so he must be on June 12.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the Defensive End and Placekicker**: From clue 3, Kurt Koch is the defensive end. From clue 4, Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker. 

2. **Assign Games to the Quarterback**: From clue 2, the person who played in 5 games last season is the quarterback.

3. **Determine Edward Ellis' Games**: From clue 1, Edward Ellis played 2 more games than the defensive end (Kurt Koch). Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end, we need to find out how many games he played to determine Edward's games.

4. **Assign Games to Kurt Koch and the Placekicker**: Since Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker, and considering the available game numbers (3, 4, 5, 6), Kurt Koch cannot play 5 games (as it is assigned to the quarterback). If Kurt Koch played 3 games, then the placekicker played 5 games, but that conflicts with the quarterback's games. Therefore, Kurt Koch must play 4 games, and the placekicker played 6 games.

5. **Assign Edward Ellis' and Remaining Games**: Since Kurt Koch played 4 games and Edward Ellis played 2 more games than Kurt, Edward Ellis must have played 6 games. However, since the placekicker is already assigned 6 games, Edward must play 5 games as the quarterback.

6. **Identify the Running Back**: From clue 5, the running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games. Since Kurt Koch (defensive end) played 4 games, Gordon Gregg must be the running back and he played 3 games.

This confirms that Rosie's pet (in February), the pet adopted in March (Kayla's black lab), and the pet adopted in April are all puppies. Since Violet's boxer is one of the puppies and we know from Clue 1 that Violet has the boxer, the boxer must be adopted in April.

4. **Considering Clue 4**: The four puppies are Rosie's pet, the dog adopted in April, the puppy adopted in February, and the puppy adopted in March. This confirms that Rosie's pet (in February), the pet adopted in March (Kayla's black lab), and the pet adopted in April are all puppies. Since Violet's boxer is one of the puppies and we know from Clue 1 that Violet has the boxer, the boxer must be adopted in April.

5. **Filling in the remaining details**: We know Lydia is the remaining owner and the shih tzu is the remaining breed not yet placed in a month with an owner. Since the shih tzu was adopted in January and Kayla, Rosie, and Violet are accounted for in other months with other breeds, Lydia must have the shih tzu in January.

6. **Final Answer**: Fill the following table to show your final answer.

| Month    | Owner  | Dog Breed  |
|----------|--------|------------|
| January  | Lydia  | shih tzu   |
| February | Rosie  | schnauzer  |
| March    | Kayla  | black lab  |

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1**: Gracie is 11 years old.

2. **Clue 5**: The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 12 years old. Since no age can be repeated and the wingspan is unique to one bird, this sets one part of our grid.

3. **Clue 4**: The 9-year-old condor is either the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches or Angel. Since the 114-inch wingspan bird is 12 years old, the 9-year-old must be Angel.

4. **Clue 3**: The 11-year-old condor (Gracie) has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old bird (Angel). We need to determine Angel's wingspan to find Gracie's.

5. **Clue 2**: The four condors are the 9-year-old condor (Angel), the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches, Buddy, and the condor with a wingspan of 110 inches. Since Angel is the 9-year-old, and Buddy is listed separately from the 9-year-old and the 110-inch wingspan bird, Buddy cannot be Angel or the 12-year-old with a 114-inch wingspan. Therefore, Buddy must be the one with a wingspan of 102 inches and the remaining age, which is 8 years old.

6. Since Angel is the 9-year-old and not Buddy, and the 114-inch wingspan bird is 12 years old (Smokey), Angel must have the next available wingspan, which is 110 inches. 

7. Since Gracie's wingspan is 4 inches shorter than Angel's 110 inches, Gracie's wingspan is 106 inches.

Final Answer:
102 inches | Buddy | 8
106 inches | Gracie | 11

"Step-by-step solution:

1. From clue 2, we know that the Disty launched in March.

2. From clue 4, the Iunsel is going to Pluto.

3. From clue 5, the Iunsel launched 1 month before the mission going to Uranus. This means the Iunsel cannot have launched in January (as there is no month before January for the Uranus mission to fit). Therefore, the Iunsel must have launched in February, and the mission to Uranus must be in March.

4. From clue 1, the Iunsel launched after the probe going to Mercury. Since the Iunsel launched in February, the probe going to Mercury must have launched in January.

5. From clue 3, the Moro Jaddo launched 1 month after the mission going to Uranus. Since the Uranus mission is in March, the Moro Jaddo must have launched in April.

6. The only remaining month for a launch is January, and the only remaining probe is Viria Mari. Since Mercury's mission is in January, Viria Mari is the probe going to Mercury.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 3

Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- Linda Lott left 1 day before the journalist who covered the flooding. This means Linda Lott did not leave on April 7th, and the flooding coverage was not on April 4th.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The four people mentioned (reporter on April 7th, reporter who covered the solar eclipse, journalist who covered the earthquake, Randy Reid) are all different. Since Randy Reid left 1 day after the solar eclipse, and the solar eclipse reporter is different from the April 7th reporter and the earthquake reporter, we can start placing some constraints:
  - Randy Reid is not the reporter for the solar eclipse or the earthquake.
  - The solar eclipse was not on April 7th.

Step 4: Place Randy Reid and the solar eclipse
- Since Randy Reid left 1 day after the solar eclipse and Randy Reid is not on April 4th, the solar eclipse must have been on April 5th, and Randy Reid on April 6th.

Step 5: Place Linda Lott and the flooding
- Since Linda Lott left 1 day before the flooding and she did not leave on April 7th, she must have left on April 4th, and the flooding was covered on April 5th.

Step 6: Place Sid Snyder and Tam Terry
- Sid Snyder left 1 day after Tam Terry. Since April 5th and April 6th are taken by the solar eclipse and Randy Reid, respectively, Tam Terry must have left on April 4th or April 6th. Since Linda Lott left on April 4th, Tam Terry must have left on April 6th, and Sid Snyder on April 7th.

Step 7: Assign the remaining story (royal wedding) and reporter
- The remaining date is April 4th for the earthquake, and the remaining reporter for April 7th is Sid Snyder. Since the earthquake and flooding are assigned, the remaining story for April 7th is the royal wedding.

Since the fares are $6.50, $9.50, $12.50, and $15.50, and Elvira paid $6 less, the only possible fare for the person picked up at the Moore Mansion that allows for a $6 difference is $12.50 (for Elvira to pay $6.50). However, since Della is already the client with the $12.50 fare, Elvira must pay $6.50, and the person at the Moore Mansion must pay $12.50. Since Della is the client with the $12.50 fare, Della must be picked up at the Moore Mansion.

Step 5: With Della at the Moore Mansion with a $12.50 fare, Wayne at the Seattle Tower, and Elvira paying $6.50, the remaining fare of $9.50 must belong to Isabel. The only remaining pickup point is Neptune Theatre.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: From clue 3, the nibner newt was recognized as endangered in 2006. This sets the first part of our table.
- 2006 | nibner newt | (population to be determined)

Step 2: From clue 1, since the nibner newt was listed in 2006, the species with a population size of 385 was listed in 2008 (2 years after 2006).
- 2008 | (species to be determined) | 385

Step 3: From clue 4, the species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx. Since we know from clue 2 that the perens pig is either in 2006 or has a population of 315, and since 2006 is already taken by the nibner newt, the perens pig must have a population of 315. Therefore, the osbele oryx must be the species with a population of 385 and listed in 2008.
- 2008 | osbele oryx | 385

Step 4: From clue 2, since the perens pig has a population of 315, it must be listed in a year other than 2006. The only years left are 2007 and 2009.
- (year to be determined) | perens pig | 315

Step 5: From clue 5, the perens pig was listed before the species with a population size of 210. Since the perens pig is either in 2007 or 2009, and it must be before the species with 210, the perens pig must be in 2007 and the species with 210 must be in 2009.
- 2007 | perens pig | 315
- 2009 | (species to be determined) | 210

Step 6: The only remaining year and species are 2009 and the eldar elk, respectively. Since the eldar elk is the only species left and 2009 is the only year left, the eldar elk must be the species with a population of 210.
- 2009 | eldar elk | 210

Step 7: The only remaining population for the nibner newt in 2006 is 280, as all other population numbers have been assigned.
- 2006 | nibner newt | 280

Final Answer:
2006 | nibner newt | 280

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 5**: The Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998. This means if we assign a decibel level to the Rip Tide, the siren from 1998 will be 10 decibels higher.

2. **Clue 4**: The Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide. This relationship helps us link the decibel levels of these two sirens.

3. **Clue 3**: The Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm. This clue helps us establish a chain of increasing decibel levels among the sirens.

4. **Clue 1**: The siren with a loudness of 105 decibels is either the siren released in 2009 or the Bradley X9. Since we know from Clue 3 that the Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm, and from Clue 4 that the Soundarm is louder than the Rip Tide, the Bradley X9 cannot be 105 decibels. Therefore, the siren released in 2009 must be the Soundarm with 105 decibels.

5. **Clue 2**: The siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009. Since the Soundarm (2009) is 105 decibels, the 1999 siren must be quieter, which fits the Rip Tide if it is less than 105 decibels.

6. From Clue 5, if we assign the Rip Tide a decibel level that is 10 decibels less than the siren from 1998, and knowing from Clue 4 that the Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide, we can start assigning specific values:
   - If Rip Tide is 100 decibels, then Soundarm is 105 decibels (fits Clue 4 and Clue 1).
   - From Clue 3, Bradley X9 being 10 decibels louder than Soundarm (105 decibels) would be 115 decibels.
   - From Clue 5, the siren from 1998, being 10 decibels louder than Rip Tide (100 decibels), would be 110 decibels.

7. The only remaining siren and year are Securalert and 2007, and the only remaining decibel level is 110 decibels. However, since we know the siren from 1998 is 110 decibels, Securalert must be the siren from 1998.

8. The only remaining year for the Bradley X9, which is 115 decibels, is 2007.

Final Answer:
100 decibels | Rip Tide | 1999
105 decibels | Soundarm | 2009

Since we know from Clue 3 that the Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm, and from Clue 4 that the Soundarm is louder than the Rip Tide, the Bradley X9 cannot be 105 decibels. Therefore, the siren released in 2009 must be the Soundarm with 105 decibels.

5. **Clue 2**: The siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009. Since the Soundarm (2009) is 105 decibels, the 1999 siren must be quieter, which fits the Rip Tide if it is less than 105 decibels.

6. From Clue 5, if we assign the Rip Tide a decibel level that is 10 decibels less than the siren from 1998, and knowing from Clue 4 that the Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide, we can start assigning specific values:
   - If Rip Tide is 100 decibels, then Soundarm is 105 decibels (fits Clue 4 and Clue 1).
   - From Clue 3, Bradley X9 being 10 decibels louder than Soundarm (105 decibels) would be 115 decibels.
   - From Clue 5, the siren from 1998, being 10 decibels louder than Rip Tide (100 decibels), would be 110 decibels.

7. The only remaining siren and year are Securalert and 2007, and the only remaining decibel level is 110 decibels. However, since we know the siren from 1998 is 110 decibels, Securalert must be the siren from 1998.

8. The only remaining year for the Bradley X9, which is 115 decibels, is 2007.

Final Answer:
100 decibels | Rip Tide | 1999
105 decibels | Soundarm | 2009
110 decibels | Securalert | 1998
115 decibels | Bradley X9 | 2007

This solution aligns all clues and categories correctly, ensuring each siren, year, and decibel level is uniquely matched.","1. **Clue 5**: The Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998. This means if we assign a decibel level to the Rip Tide, the siren from 1998 will be 10 decibels higher.

2. **Clue 4**: The Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide. This relationship helps us link the decibel levels of these two sirens.

3. **Clue 3**: The Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm. This clue helps us establish a chain of increasing decibel levels among the sirens.

4. **Clue 1**: The siren with a loudness of 105 decibels is either the siren released in 2009 or the Bradley X9. Since we know from Clue 3 that the Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm, and from Clue 4 that the Soundarm is louder than the Rip Tide, the Bradley X9 cannot be 105 decibels. Therefore, the siren released in 2009 must be the Soundarm with 105 decibels.

5. **Clue 2**: The siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009. Since the Soundarm (2009) is 105 decibels, the 1999 siren must be quieter, which fits the Rip Tide if it is less than 105 decibels.

6. From Clue 5, if we assign the Rip Tide a decibel level that is 10 decibels less than the siren from 1998, and knowing from Clue 4 that the Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide, we can start assigning specific values:
   - If Rip Tide is 100 decibels, then Soundarm is 105 decibels (fits Clue 4 and Clue 1).
   - From Clue 3, Bradley X9 being 10 decibels louder than Soundarm (105 decibels) would be 115 decibels.
   - From Clue 5, the siren from 1998, being 10 decibels louder than Rip Tide (100 decibels), would be 110 decibels.

7. The only remaining siren and year are Securalert and 2007, and the only remaining decibel level is 110 decibels. However, since we know the siren from 1998 is 110 decibels, Securalert must be the siren from 1998.

8. The only remaining year for the Bradley X9, which is 115 decibels, is 2007.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyzing Clue 5**
- The Sameos culture was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people. This means Sameos must be in 100 AD and the culture with 7,500 people in 350 AD.

**Step 2: Analyzing Clue 4**
- The culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people. Since the culture with 9,500 people must be founded after 100 AD (as Sameos is there), the only possible year for the culture with 9,500 people is 600 AD, making the culture with 5,000 people in 350 AD.

**Step 3: Analyzing Clue 2**
- The culture with 9,500 people was founded before the culture with 4,500 people. Since the culture with 9,500 people is in 600 AD, the culture with 4,500 people must be in 850 AD.

**Step 4: Analyzing Clue 3**
- Of the culture with 4,500 people and the culture with 9,500 people, one was the Budel culture and the other was founded in 600 AD. Since the culture with 9,500 people is in 600 AD, Budel must be the culture with 9,500 people.

**Step 5: Analyzing Clue 1**
- The Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people are all different. Since the culture with 4,500 people is in 850 AD, Oiracha cannot be in 850 AD or have 4,500 people. Since 850 AD is taken by the culture with 4,500 people, Oiracha must be in 100 AD.

**Step 6: Placing Remaining Culture and Population**
- With Oiracha in 100 AD and Sameos in 350 AD, the remaining culture for 850 AD is Hatgare. Since the populations 9,500 and 4,500 are taken by Budel and 850 AD respectively, and 7,500 is in 350 AD, the remaining population for 100 AD is 5,000.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.

- The Sameos culture was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people. This means Sameos must be in 100 AD and the culture with 7,500 people in 350 AD.

**Step 2: Analyzing Clue 4**
- The culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people. Since the culture with 9,500 people must be founded after 100 AD (as Sameos is there), the only possible year for the culture with 9,500 people is 600 AD, making the culture with 5,000 people in 350 AD.

**Step 3: Analyzing Clue 2**
- The culture with 9,500 people was founded before the culture with 4,500 people. Since the culture with 9,500 people is in 600 AD, the culture with 4,500 people must be in 850 AD.

**Step 4: Analyzing Clue 3**
- Of the culture with 4,500 people and the culture with 9,500 people, one was the Budel culture and the other was founded in 600 AD. Since the culture with 9,500 people is in 600 AD, Budel must be the culture with 9,500 people.

**Step 5: Analyzing Clue 1**
- The Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people are all different. Since the culture with 4,500 people is in 850 AD, Oiracha cannot be in 850 AD or have 4,500 people. Since 850 AD is taken by the culture with 4,500 people, Oiracha must be in 100 AD.

**Step 6: Placing Remaining Culture and Population**
- With Oiracha in 100 AD and Sameos in 350 AD, the remaining culture for 850 AD is Hatgare. Since the populations 9,500 and 4,500 are taken by Budel and 850 AD respectively, and 7,500 is in 350 AD, the remaining population for 100 AD is 5,000.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
100 AD | Oiracha | 5,000

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **From Clue 3:** Casputi was discovered in 2009. This directly fills one part of our table.

2. **From Clue 1:** Since Wally Six is either the comet Tillman discovered or the comet discovered in 2009, and Casputi is the comet discovered in 2009, Wally Six must be the comet Tillman discovered.

3. **From Clue 4:** Of the comet discovered in 2010 and the one discovered in 2008, one is Wally Six and the other was first seen by Jack Ingram. Since Wally Six is the comet Tillman discovered, it cannot be the comet discovered in 2009. Therefore, Wally Six must be either the comet discovered in 2008 or 2010.

4. **From Clue 2:** Of Trosny and Casputi, one was found in 2008 and the other was first seen by Hal Gregory. Since Casputi was discovered in 2009, Trosny must be the comet discovered in 2008.

5. **Assigning Hal Gregory:** Since Trosny was discovered in 2008 and one of Trosny or Casputi was first seen by Hal Gregory, Hal Gregory must be the astronomer who discovered Trosny in 2008.

6. **Assigning Jack Ingram:** Since Wally Six is either in 2008 or 2010 and Trosny (2008) was discovered by Hal Gregory, Wally Six must be the comet discovered in 2010. Therefore, Jack Ingram, who saw either the 2008 or 2010 comet, must have discovered the remaining comet in 2011.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Starting with Clue 5**: Lyle Lucas started in 2007. We don't yet know his superhero identity.

2. **Using Clue 3**: ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino. We need to determine his starting year.

3. **Applying Clue 4**: Of ""Ultra Hex"" and Peter Powers, one began his crusade in 2009 and the other in 2010. Since ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino, we need to determine which year between 2009 and 2010 he started.

4. **Considering Clue 2**: The hero who started in 2009 is either ""Criminal Bane"" or Peter Powers. Since one of them is Peter Powers and the other could be ""Criminal Bane"", we need to determine which one is which.

5. **Using Clue 1**: ""Green Avenger"" began 1 year before Peter Powers. This means Peter Powers cannot have started in 2007, as that would imply ""Green Avenger"" started in 2006, which is not a listed year. Therefore, Peter Powers must have started in 2010, and ""Green Avenger"" in 2009.

6. **From Step 5 and Clue 4**: Since Peter Powers started in 2010, ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) must have started in 2009.

7. **From Step 6 and Clue 2**: Since ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) started in 2009, ""Criminal Bane"" cannot have started in 2009. Therefore, ""Criminal Bane"" did not start in 2009, and Peter Powers is not ""Criminal Bane"".

8. **Identifying ""Green Avenger""**: Since ""Green Avenger"" started in 2009 and is not Peter Powers, and ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino who also started in 2009, ""Green Avenger"" must be someone else. Since Peter Powers started in 2010, he cannot be ""Green Avenger"".

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Assign the known years to the windmills based on the clues:**
- From clue 2, Grosmolen was built in 1729.
- From clue 3, Vlietmolen was built in 1706.

**Step 2: Analyze the remaining windmills and years:**
- The remaining years are 1683 and 1752.
- The remaining windmills are Doesmolen and Zemelmolen.

**Step 3: Apply clue 1:**
- Since Grosmolen was built in 1729 and is owned by the De Vries family (as it cannot be Doesmolen), Doesmolen must be built in 1683.

**Step 4: Assign the remaining windmill to the remaining year:**
- Zemelmolen is the only remaining windmill, so it must be built in 1752.

**Step 5: Apply clue 4:**
- The Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill.
- Since Zemelmolen was built in 1752, subtracting 23 years gives 1729, which is already taken by Grosmolen and De Vries.
- Therefore, Meijer must be in 1706 (Vlietmolen), and Bakker must be in 1683 (Doesmolen).

**Step 6: Assign the remaining family to the remaining windmill:**
- The only remaining family is Van Dijk, and the only remaining year with an unassigned family is 1752.
- Therefore, Zemelmolen (1752) is owned by the Van Dijk family.

**Final Answer:**
1683 | Doesmolen | Bakker

- From clue 2, Grosmolen was built in 1729.
- From clue 3, Vlietmolen was built in 1706.

**Step 2: Analyze the remaining windmills and years:**
- The remaining years are 1683 and 1752.
- The remaining windmills are Doesmolen and Zemelmolen.

**Step 3: Apply clue 1:**
- Since Grosmolen was built in 1729 and is owned by the De Vries family (as it cannot be Doesmolen), Doesmolen must be built in 1683.

**Step 4: Assign the remaining windmill to the remaining year:**
- Zemelmolen is the only remaining windmill, so it must be built in 1752.

**Step 5: Apply clue 4:**
- The Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill.
- Since Zemelmolen was built in 1752, subtracting 23 years gives 1729, which is already taken by Grosmolen and De Vries.
- Therefore, Meijer must be in 1706 (Vlietmolen), and Bakker must be in 1683 (Doesmolen).

**Step 6: Assign the remaining family to the remaining windmill:**
- The only remaining family is Van Dijk, and the only remaining year with an unassigned family is 1752.
- Therefore, Zemelmolen (1752) is owned by the Van Dijk family.

**Final Answer:**
1683 | Doesmolen | Bakker
1706 | Vlietmolen | Meijer
1729 | Grosmolen | De Vries
1752 | Zemelmolen | Van Dijk

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5**
- Clue 4 states that Fushil was discovered before Teuz.
- Clue 5 states that the island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm.

**Step 2: Determine the relationship between Fushil, Teuz, and Jujihm**
- Since Fushil was discovered before Teuz and the Hakili people's island was discovered 7 years before Jujihm, we need to find a year for Jujihm that allows another island to be 7 years earlier.

**Step 3: Assign years based on Clue 5**
- If Jujihm was discovered in 1775, then the island of the Hakili people (7 years earlier) would be 1768. This fits as there are no contradictions with other clues.

**Step 4: Use Clue 1 and Clue 2**
- Clue 1 states that the Holo'oka people lived on either Jujihm or Teuz.
- Clue 2 states that of the island on which the Holo'oka people lived and the island discovered in 1761, one was Fushil and the other was Teuz. Since we know Fushil was discovered before Teuz, Fushil must be the island discovered in 1761, and Teuz must be the island where the Holo'oka people lived.

**Step 5: Assign remaining years and islands**
- Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and Teuz where Holo'oka lived must be after Fushil, Teuz can be placed in 1775 with Holo'oka.
- Since Jujihm was discovered in 1775 and Hakili was 7 years before, Hakili must be on the island discovered in 1768.

**Step 6: Assign the remaining island and culture**
- The remaining years are 1754 and 1768.
- Since Hakili is in 1768, the remaining culture for 1754 must be Manika'i.
- The remaining island for 1754 is Zafet.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Using Clue 1**: Gene paid $7.75. This directly gives us one part of our solution.

2. **Using Clue 4**: Rosa asked for chia seeds. This identifies the superfood for Rosa.

3. **Using Clue 2**: Rosa paid $1 more than the person who requested ginger. Since Rosa paid more, she did not pay the lowest price. Since Gene paid $7.75, Rosa must have paid $8.75.

4. **Using Clue 3**: The person who requested acai berries and the customer who requested ginger, one paid $8.75 and the other is Delores. Since Rosa paid $8.75 and asked for chia seeds, Delores must be the one who requested ginger. Since Rosa paid $1 more than the person who requested ginger, Delores must have paid $7.75. However, since Gene already paid $7.75, Delores must have paid $6.75.

5. **Remaining Assignments**: The remaining prices are $9.75. The remaining superfood is kale, and the remaining customer is Betsy. Therefore, Betsy must have paid $9.75 and requested kale.

6. **Assigning Superfood to Gene**: Since Gene paid $7.75 and the only remaining superfood for him is acai berries (as per Clue 3), Gene must have requested acai berries.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Using Clue 3 and Clue 4**: Clue 3 states that the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's computer. Clue 4 states that the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM. If we assume the computer with 1 GB of RAM has the smallest hard drive (128 GB), then the computer with 4 GB of RAM would have 384 GB (128 GB + 256 GB).

2. **Using Clue 1**: Jack's computer is either the system with 256 GB of hard drive space or the build with 4 GB of RAM. Since we already determined that the computer with 4 GB of RAM has 384 GB, Jack must have the 384 GB hard drive.

3. **Using Clue 5**: The computer with 256 GB of hard drive space is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM. Since we know from Clue 2 that the computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive smaller than Alejandro's, and since 256 GB cannot be smaller than any other remaining options except 128 GB, the computer with 12 GB of RAM must have 128 GB, and Otis must have the 256 GB hard drive.

4. **Using Clue 2**: Since the computer with 12 GB of RAM has 128 GB, and it is smaller than Alejandro's, Alejandro must have a larger hard drive. The only options left are 384 GB and 512 GB. Since Jack has 384 GB, Alejandro must have 512 GB.

5. **Assigning Victor**: Victor's computer must have a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM (from Clue 3). Since the computer with 1 GB of RAM has 128 GB, Victor's computer must have 384 GB. However, since Jack already has 384 GB, and Alejandro has 512 GB, Victor must have the remaining option, which is 512 GB. This contradicts our earlier assignment, indicating a mistake in the initial assumptions. Revisiting the clues, we realize that Victor must have 512 GB, and Alejandro must have 384 GB.

6. **Assigning RAM**: The remaining RAM options are 1 GB and 3 GB. Since we know the computer with 1 GB of RAM has 128 GB, and the computer with 12 GB of RAM also has 128 GB, the remaining RAM for Alejandro (384 GB) must be 3 GB, and Otis (256 GB) must have 1 GB.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Harry is the musician** (Clue 1). This assigns Harry's career.

2. **Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's** (Clue 2). This means Dale's birthday is exactly one month after Harry's.

3. **Adrian has a birthday 1 month after the surgeon** (Clue 3). Adrian's birthday is exactly one month after the surgeon's.

4. **The architect has a birthday 2 months after the surgeon** (Clue 4). This places the architect's birthday two months after the surgeon's.

Now, let's assign the birthdays:
- Since Harry is the musician and Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's, we need to find a pair of months that are one month apart. The possible pairs are April 13th & May 18th, May 18th & June 14th, June 14th & July 16th.

- Since Adrian's birthday is 1 month after the surgeon's and the architect's birthday is 2 months after the surgeon's, we need to find a sequence of three months that are consecutive. The only possible sequence that fits is April 13th (surgeon), May 18th (Adrian), and July 16th (architect).

Given this sequence:
- The surgeon's birthday must be April 13th.
- Adrian's birthday, being 1 month after the surgeon, is May 18th.
- The architect's birthday, being 2 months after the surgeon, is July 16th.

Now, we know:
- Harry is the musician, and Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's. Since Adrian and the architect occupy May 18th and July 16th, respectively, Harry must be June 14th, and Dale must be July 16th.

5. Since Harry is the musician and Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's, we need to find a pair of months that are one month apart. The possible pairs are April 13th & May 18th, May 18th & June 14th, June 14th & July 16th.

6. Since Adrian's birthday is 1 month after the surgeon's and the architect's birthday is 2 months after the surgeon's, we need to find a sequence of three months that are consecutive. The only possible sequence that fits is April 13th (surgeon), May 18th (Adrian), and July 16th (architect).

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis**: The alligator that is 14.0 feet long is either the 20-year-old alligator or Arthur. We cannot assign this yet, so we'll keep this in mind.

2. **Clue 2 Analysis**: The animal that is 11.5 feet long is younger than Arthur. This means Arthur cannot be the youngest, so he is not 5 years old.

3. **Clue 3 Analysis**: Of the animal that is 12.0 feet long and Carlos, one is 20 years old and the other is 10 years old. This means Carlos is either 10 or 20 years old, and the 12.0 feet long alligator is either 10 or 20 years old.

4. **Clue 4 Analysis**: The alligator that is 11.5 feet long is 5 years younger than Carlos. Since the 11.5 feet long alligator is younger than Arthur and younger than Carlos, it must be the youngest, which is 5 years old. If Carlos is 5 years older than the 5-year-old alligator, Carlos must be 10 years old.

5. **Clue 5 Analysis**: Iggy is 10 years younger than the animal that is 14.0 feet long. Since the 14.0 feet long alligator is either 20 years old or Arthur, and since we know from clue 1 that it can't be Arthur (as Arthur is not 20 years old), the 14.0 feet long alligator must be 20 years old. Therefore, Iggy is 10 years younger than 20 years old, making Iggy 10 years old.

6. **Revising Carlos and Iggy's Age**: Since Carlos is 10 years old and Iggy is also 10 years old, and Carlos is either 10 or 20 years old, Carlos must be the 20-year-old alligator. This means the 12.0 feet long alligator is 10 years old.

7. **Assigning Carlos and Iggy**: Since Carlos is 20 years old and the 14.0 feet long alligator is 20 years old, Carlos must be 14.0 feet long. This leaves Arthur to be the remaining age and length not yet assigned. Since the 11.5 feet long alligator is 5 years old and the 12.0 feet long alligator is 10 years old, Arthur must be 15 years old and 13.6 feet long.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The 9:00am tour starts at Greektown.
   - This directly places Greektown at 9:00am.

2. **Clue 3**: Of the trip starting at Greektown and the outing starting at High Park, one is with Janice and the other will be at 7:00am.
   - Since Greektown is at 9:00am, High Park must be at 7:00am.
   - Since Janice is associated with either Greektown or High Park and Greektown is at 9:00am, Janice must be the guide for Greektown at 9:00am.

3. **Clue 4**: Dustin's trip will start at Casa Loma.
   - This places Dustin at Casa Loma, but the time is not yet determined.

4. **Clue 2**: Faye's outing will begin 1 hour before Kelly's tour.
   - This means Faye and Kelly are consecutive in terms of time slots.

Given the above deductions:
- 7:00am is High Park.
- 9:00am is Greektown with Janice.
- Dustin is at Casa Loma, time to be determined.
- Faye starts 1 hour before Kelly.

5. **Time Assignment**:
   - Since 7:00am is High Park and 9:00am is Greektown with Janice, the remaining times are 8:00am and 10:00am.
   - Dustin is at Casa Loma, and since Faye starts 1 hour before Kelly, the only logical assignment without overlapping is Dustin at 10:00am at Casa Loma (as placing him at 8:00am would not allow Faye and Kelly to be consecutive).
   - This leaves 8:00am for Faye and Kelly must then be at 9:00am. However, since Janice is already at 9:00am, Kelly must be at 8:00am and Faye at 7:00am.

6. **Location Assignment**:
   - Since 7:00am is High Park and Faye is at 7:00am, she must be at High Park.
   - Kelly at 8:00am must be at the remaining location, which is Little Italy.

8:00am | Kelly | Little Italy
9:00am | Janice | Greektown
10:00am | Dustin | Casa Loma","Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The 9:00am tour starts at Greektown.
   - This directly places Greektown at 9:00am.

2. **Clue 3**: Of the trip starting at Greektown and the outing starting at High Park, one is with Janice and the other will be at 7:00am.
   - Since Greektown is at 9:00am, High Park must be at 7:00am.
   - Since Janice is associated with either Greektown or High Park and Greektown is at 9:00am, Janice must be the guide for Greektown at 9:00am.

3. **Clue 4**: Dustin's trip will start at Casa Loma.
   - This places Dustin at Casa Loma, but the time is not yet determined.

4. **Clue 2**: Faye's outing will begin 1 hour before Kelly's tour.
   - This means Faye and Kelly are consecutive in terms of time slots.

Given the above deductions:
- 7:00am is High Park.
- 9:00am is Greektown with Janice.
- Dustin is at Casa Loma, time to be determined.
- Faye starts 1 hour before Kelly.

5. **Time Assignment**:
   - Since 7:00am is High Park and 9:00am is Greektown with Janice, the remaining times are 8:00am and 10:00am.
   - Dustin is at Casa Loma, and since Faye starts 1 hour before Kelly, the only logical assignment without overlapping is Dustin at 10:00am at Casa Loma (as placing him at 8:00am would not allow Faye and Kelly to be consecutive).
   - This leaves 8:00am for Faye and Kelly must then be at 9:00am. However, since Janice is already at 9:00am, Kelly must be at 8:00am and Faye at 7:00am.

6. **Location Assignment**:
   - Since 7:00am is High Park and Faye is at 7:00am, she must be at High Park.
   - Kelly at 8:00am must be at the remaining location, which is Little Italy.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Analyzing Clue 2**: The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet. This means Ellen's pet cannot be in January or February, and the macaw cannot be in March or April. Therefore, the macaw was bought in January and Ellen's pet in March.

2. **Analyzing Clue 1**: Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January (macaw), one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw. Since the macaw is in January, Gladys's pet must be in February.

3. **Analyzing Clue 4**: Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet. Since Gladys's pet is in February, Alberta's pet must be in January.

4. **Analyzing Clue 5 and 3**: The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird, and the parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch. This sequence can only fit starting from February onward. Since the macaw is in January, the lovebird must be in February, the finch in March, and the parakeet in April.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Assigning Zeke's Spruce**: From Clue 4, Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall.

2. **Determining the height of the 94 year-old tree**: Clue 1 states that the Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94 year-old tree. Since we don't know the height of the 94 year-old tree yet, we'll need to use other clues to determine it.

3. **Determining the characteristics of The Senator and Marsh Tree**: Clue 2 states that one of The Senator and Marsh Tree is 85 years old and the other is 153 ft. tall. Since we don't know which is which yet, we'll need to use other clues to determine it.

4. **Comparing The Senator to the 96 year-old tree**: Clue 3 states that The Senator is taller than the 96 year-old tree. This means the 96 year-old tree cannot be 153 ft. tall.

5. **Assigning heights and ages based on exclusions and remaining options**:
   - Since Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall, the remaining heights are 144 ft., 150 ft., and 153 ft.
   - Since The Senator is taller than the 96 year-old tree, and the only remaining heights taller than 147 ft. are 150 ft. and 153 ft., The Senator must be 153 ft. tall.
   - Since The Senator is 153 ft. tall, Marsh Tree must be 85 years old (from Clue 2).
   - The 94 year-old tree must then be 150 ft. tall (3 ft. shorter than Marsh Tree, 150 ft. - 3 ft. = 147 ft., but since Zeke's Spruce is already 147 ft., the next possible height for the 94 year-old tree is 150 ft.).
   - The remaining tree, Evan's Fir, must be 144 ft. tall and the only remaining age is 96 years.

"**Step-by-Step Solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- ""The camera made by Banion costs 25 dollars more than the DM-5000.""
- This clue links the price of Banion's camera to the price of the DM-5000.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- ""Of the camera made by Honwa and the camera made by Banion, one is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550.""
- This clue tells us that either Honwa or Banion has a camera costing $550, and one of them has the Tela G5.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- ""The FC-520 costs 50 dollars more than the model made by Cober.""
- This clue establishes a price relationship between the FC-520 and Cober's camera.

**Step 4: Assign Prices**
- If we assume the DM-5000 costs $550 (the lowest price), then according to Clue 1, Banion's camera costs $575.
- From Clue 2, since Banion's camera costs $575, Honwa's camera must cost $550.

**Step 5: Determine Camera Models**
- Since Honwa's camera costs $550 and from Clue 2, one of Honwa or Banion's cameras is the Tela G5, Honwa must have the Tela G5.
- Therefore, Banion does not have the Tela G5, and since Banion's camera costs $575, we need to assign a model to Banion.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Prices and Models**
- From Clue 3, the FC-520 costs $50 more than Cober's camera. If Cober's camera costs $600, then the FC-520 must cost $625.
- The only company left for the FC-520 is Dayero.
- The only remaining camera model for Banion is the G-290.
- Cober's camera must be the DM-5000, as it's the only model left that fits the price.

**Final Answer:**
$550 | Honwa | Tela G5
$575 | Banion | G-290
$600 | Cober | DM-5000
$625 | Dayero | FC-520

- Since Honwa's camera costs $550 and from Clue 2, one of Honwa or Banion's cameras is the Tela G5, Honwa must have the Tela G5.
- Therefore, Banion does not have the Tela G5, and since Banion's camera costs $575, we need to assign a model to Banion.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Prices and Models**
- From Clue 3, the FC-520 costs $50 more than Cober's camera. If Cober's camera costs $600, then the FC-520 must cost $625.
- The only company left for the FC-520 is Dayero.
- The only remaining camera model for Banion is the G-290.
- Cober's camera must be the DM-5000, as it's the only model left that fits the price.

**Final Answer:**
$550 | Honwa | Tela G5
$575 | Banion | G-290
$600 | Cober | DM-5000
$625 | Dayero | FC-520

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify Lirios' Camera**: From clue 4, we know that the camera made by Lirios is the Lectra 6.

2. **Determine the Tela G5 and $550 Camera**: Clue 3 states that either the camera made by Torvia or the camera made by Nectron is the Tela G5, and one of them costs $550. Since the Tela G5 costs $25 more than the Zenix 2C (clue 5), the Zenix 2C cannot be the cheapest camera. Therefore, the camera costing $550 is not the Tela G5, and it must be the other option between Torvia and Nectron.

3. **Assign Prices to Torvia and Nectron**: From clue 2, the Zenix 2C costs more than the model made by Torvia. Since the Zenix 2C is not the cheapest, and the model by Torvia is not the Tela G5 (from step 2), the Torvia model must be the one costing $550. Consequently, the Tela G5, which is not the $550 camera, must be the Nectron model and costs $575 (as it is $25 more than $550).

4. **Price of Lectra 6**: From clue 1, the camera made by Lirios (Lectra 6) costs $25 more than the model made by Torvia. Since Torvia's model costs $550, Lirios' Lectra 6 costs $550 + $25 = $575. This is incorrect as per the earlier deduction that the Tela G5 costs $575. Therefore, the Lectra 6 must cost $600.

5. **Assign Remaining Camera and Price**: The remaining camera, the Zenix 2C, must be made by Dayero and costs $25 less than the Tela G5 (from clue 5). Since the Tela G5 costs $575, the Zenix 2C costs $575 - $25 = $550. This is incorrect as per the earlier deduction that Torvia's model costs $550. Therefore, the Zenix 2C must cost $600. The only remaining price is $625, which must be for the remaining camera, the DM-5000, made by the remaining company, which is Dayero.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 - The March account and the sighting at Laurel Grove were different events.
- This means that the event in March is not at Laurel Grove.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1 - Of the sighting at Laurel Grove and Francis's account, one happened in March and the other happened in May.
- Since March is not Laurel Grove (from Step 1), Francis's account must be in March. Therefore, Laurel Grove's sighting is in May.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 5 - The sighting at Seryl Forest was either Wanda's event or the June event.
- Since we know the events for March (Francis) and May (Laurel Grove), Seryl Forest must be either in April or June.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2 - Hannah's event took place 2 months after the account at Seryl Forest.
- If Seryl Forest is in April, then Hannah's event would be in June. If Seryl Forest is in June, then Hannah's event would be in August, which is not an option. Therefore, Seryl Forest is in April and Hannah's event is in June.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 4 - The account at Juniper Springs was either the April sighting or Hannah's sighting.
- Since Hannah's event is in June (from Step 4) and Juniper Springs can't be in April (because Seryl Forest is already assigned to April), Juniper Springs must be the location of Hannah's event in June.

Step 6: Assign remaining options:
- Wanda's event is at Seryl Forest in April (from Clue 5 and elimination).
- Jenny is the only witness left, and the only month left is May, so Jenny's event is at Laurel Grove in May.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
Peggy was born 6 minutes before the Underwoods' baby. This means Peggy must have been born at 12:01am, and the Underwoods' baby at 12:07am.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The Ortegas' baby was either Susan or the child born at 12:04am. This means Susan is the Ortegas' baby and she was born at 12:04am.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The four babies were Maxine, the child born at 12:10am, the Blanchards' baby, and the baby born at 12:07am. Since the Underwoods' baby was born at 12:07am, the Blanchards' baby must be either Maxine or the child born at 12:10am.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
Of the Ortegas' child and the baby born at 12:10am, one was Luis and the other was Susan. Since Susan is the Ortegas' baby at 12:04am, Luis must be the baby born at 12:10am.

Step 5: Assign remaining names and families
Since Luis is the baby born at 12:10am and from Clue 3, the Blanchards' baby is either Maxine or the child born at 12:10am, Luis must be the Blanchards' baby. This leaves Maxine as the Underwoods' baby at 12:07am. The remaining family for 12:01am (Peggy) is Vaughan.

Final Answer:
12:01am | Peggy | Vaughan
12:04am | Susan | Ortega

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: From Clue 3, Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk.
- If Verinya was discovered in 1754, then Nuhirk was discovered in 1761.
- If Verinya was discovered in 1761, then Nuhirk was discovered in 1768.
- If Verinya was discovered in 1768, then Nuhirk was discovered in 1775.
- Verinya cannot be discovered in 1775 as it would make Nuhirk's discovery year 1782, which is not listed.

Step 2: From Clue 5, Fushil was either discovered in 1768 or 1754.
- This leaves only two options for Fushil's discovery year.

Step 3: From Clue 2, one of the islands where Kukani or Wainani lived was discovered in 1761, and the other was Nuhirk.
- Since Nuhirk could be discovered in 1761, 1768, or 1775, and one of these or 1761 must be the discovery year for either Kukani or Wainani.

Step 4: Combine Clues 2 and 3 - If Verinya was discovered in 1754, then Nuhirk was discovered in 1761.
- If Nuhirk was discovered in 1761, then either Kukani or Wainani was discovered in 1761. The other must be Nuhirk.

Step 5: From Clue 1, Zafet was either the island on which the Kukani people lived or the island on which the Manika'i people lived.
- Since we know from Clue 2 that either Kukani or Wainani was in 1761 and one was Nuhirk, Zafet cannot be Nuhirk.

Step 6: Combine Clues 1, 2, and 4 - If Zafet was the island of Kukani or Manika'i, and considering the Enakai people lived on an island discovered after Manika'i, we can start placing these cultures on islands not yet assigned.

Step 7: Assigning years based on available data:
- Verinya in 1754 (leads to Nuhirk in 1761).
- Fushil in 1768 (as per Clue 5).
- Remaining island Zafet in 1775.

Step 8: Placing cultures:
- If Nuhirk was discovered in 1761 and it was either Kukani or Wainani, and since Zafet was either Kukani or Manika'i, we can deduce:
  - Nuhirk had Wainani (as Kukani fits better with Zafet in 1775).
  - Zafet had Kukani.
  - Verinya then had Manika'i (as it was discovered before Nuhirk).
  - Fushil had Enakai (as it was discovered after Manika'i).

Final Answer:
1754 | Verinya | Manika'i
1761 | Nuhirk | Wainani

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 3 Analysis**: Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka. This means if Angry Ants is in March, then Peter Parka is in April, and vice versa. However, since there are only four months and Angry Ants cannot be in April (as it needs a month before it), Angry Ants must be in March and Peter Parka in April.

2. **Clue 4 Analysis**: Of Peter Parka and the application released in May, one was made by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo. Since Peter Parka is in April, the May app must be the other game by either Apptastic or Gadingo.

3. **Clue 2 Analysis**: Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic. Since we know the May app is either by Apptastic or Gadingo, and Wizard World follows an Apptastic app, the May app must be by Apptastic, and Wizard World in June by Vortia (as it follows the May app).

4. **Clue 1 Analysis**: Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez, and the game released in May are all different apps. Since the May app is by Apptastic and is not Vitalinks or the BeGamez app, Vitalinks must be in a different month. The only month left for Vitalinks is May, and it cannot be by BeGamez.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
- Charlie Group deployed 1 hour before India Group.
This clue indicates a direct time relationship between Charlie and India.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- Charlie Group is either the squad that jumped at 8:00am or the squad that dropped at Ezra Forest.
Since Charlie is 1 hour before India, and considering the times available (8:00am, 9:00am, 10:00am, 11:00am), Charlie cannot jump at 10:00am or 11:00am because there wouldn't be an hour gap before India.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
- Of the squad that dropped at Anthon Ridge and the team that jumped at 10:00am, one is Foxtrot Group and the other is India Group.
This clue helps us place either Foxtrot or India at 10:00am and the other at Anthon Ridge.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 3
- Of the team that jumped at 9:00am and the squad that jumped at 10:00am, one is India Group and the other was dropped at Crestline X.
Since India could be at 10:00am, the 9:00am slot must be the one at Crestline X.

Step 5: Deductions from Steps 2, 3, and 4
- If Charlie is at 8:00am, then India must be at 9:00am (1 hour later as per Clue 4). But this contradicts Clue 3 where India or Crestline X must be at 10:00am. Therefore, Charlie cannot be at 8:00am.
- Charlie must be at Ezra Forest, and since Charlie is 1 hour before India, India cannot be at 10:00am (as it would make Charlie at 9:00am, contradicting the placement of Crestline X or India at 10:00am).
- Thus, Charlie is at 10:00am at Ezra Forest, and India is at 11:00am.

Step 6: Placing Foxtrot and Whiskey
- From Clue 2, since India is at 11:00am, Foxtrot must be at 10:00am, but since Charlie is already placed at 10:00am, Foxtrot must be at Anthon Ridge.
- Whiskey, being the only team left, must be at 8:00am.

Step 7: Placing Crestline X
- From Clue 3, since India is not at 10:00am, Crestline X must be at 9:00am.

Step 8: Placing Frazier Park
- The only remaining slot for location is 11:00am for India.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: From Clue 4, the sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days to finish than Ed Alexander. This means Ed Alexander did not sail the pilot cutter.

Step 2: From Clue 3, Tara Carroll took 4 more days to finish than Ed Alexander. This sets a direct relationship between their finishing days.

Step 3: From Clue 1, Wendell Orr was either the sailor who finished in 270 days or the person in the gaff cutter. 

Step 4: From Clue 2, Of Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop, one finished in 270 days and the other finished in 278 days.

Step 5: Since the pilot cutter finished 4 days before Ed Alexander, and the only days that fit this relationship are 270 days for the pilot cutter and 274 days for Ed Alexander.

Step 6: With Ed Alexander finishing in 274 days, Tara Carroll, who finishes 4 days after Ed Alexander, must finish in 278 days.

Step 7: Since the pilot cutter is at 270 days and Wendell Orr is either at 270 days or in the gaff cutter, and since the pilot cutter is already assigned, Wendell Orr must be in the gaff cutter. Since Tara Carroll is now assigned to 278 days, Wendell Orr cannot be at 270 days, so he must be at 282 days.

"**Step-by-Step Solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the beverage that cost $3.60 and the iced americano, one was ordered by Henry and the other by Charlie. This means Henry and Charlie must have ordered either the $3.60 drink or the iced americano.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Darrell's coffee cost 20 cents less than Charlie's. Since Charlie's could be either $3.60 or the price of the iced americano, we need to find a price 20 cents less than a possible price for Charlie's drink.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Jacob's drink cost 20 cents less than the espresso. This clue will help us once we have more information about the espresso's price.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The vanilla latte cost more than Darrell's drink. This helps us place the vanilla latte in a higher price bracket relative to Darrell's drink.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clues 1 and 2**
- If Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink, Darrell's drink would be $3.40 (20 cents less). If Charlie ordered the iced americano, we need to find its price and subtract 20 cents for Darrell's drink. Since the iced americano cannot be the cheapest ($3.30) because it needs to be more than Darrell's, and it can't be the most expensive ($3.60), it must be either $3.40 or $3.50. If the iced americano is $3.40, Darrell's drink would be $3.20, which is not an option. Therefore, the iced americano must be $3.50, making Darrell's drink $3.30.

**Step 6: Assign prices based on deductions**
- Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink, and Henry ordered the iced americano at $3.50.
- Darrell ordered a drink costing $3.30.

**Step 7: Use Clue 3**
- Jacob's drink cost 20 cents less than the espresso. Since the remaining prices are $3.40 and $3.30, and Darrell already has the $3.30 drink, the espresso must be $3.40, and Jacob's drink must be $3.20, which is not an option. Therefore, Jacob must have ordered the vanilla latte at $3.40.

**Step 8: Assign remaining drinks**
- Since Jacob's drink is $3.40 and Darrell's drink is $3.30, Jacob must have ordered the vanilla latte (as it costs more than Darrell's drink, per Clue 4).

**Step 9: Assign the remaining drink to the remaining customer**
- Henry ordered the iced americano at $3.50, leaving the macchiato for Charlie at $3.60.

**Final Answer:**
$3.30 | Darrell | macchiato
$3.40 | Jacob | vanilla latte
$3.50 | Henry | iced americano

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 2**
- Clue 1: Amerigo made $6 million less than the movie directed by Hick Harmon.
- Clue 2: Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo.

From these clues, we can establish a relationship between the earnings of Amerigo, Zephyr Breeze, and the movie directed by Hick Harmon.

**Step 2: Determine the earnings of Amerigo and Zephyr Breeze**
- Since the earnings options are $2 million, $5 million, $8 million, and $11 million, and Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo, the only possible values for Amerigo and Zephyr Breeze that fit the earnings options and their difference are:
  Amerigo = $2 million, Zephyr Breeze = $8 million.

**Step 3: Use Clue 1 to find the earnings of the movie directed by Hick Harmon**
- Since Amerigo made $2 million and it made $6 million less than the movie directed by Hick Harmon, the movie directed by Hick Harmon must have made $8 million.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4: Of the movie directed by Nan Norman and Easy to Love, one made $11 million and the other made $2 million.
- Since Amerigo already made $2 million, Easy to Love cannot make $2 million. Therefore, Easy to Love must have made $11 million.

**Step 5: Determine the earnings of Tippecanoe**
- The remaining earnings option is $5 million, which must be assigned to Tippecanoe.

**Step 6: Use Clue 3 to find the director of Tippecanoe**
- Clue 3: The movie directed by Micah Moreno made somewhat more than Tippecanoe.
- Since Tippecanoe made $5 million, the movie directed by Micah Moreno must be Zephyr Breeze, which made $8 million.

**Step 7: Assign directors to remaining movies**
- Since Easy to Love made $11 million and the options left for directors are Nan Norman and Odette Olson, and since we know from Clue 4 that Nan Norman's movie made either $11 million or $2 million, Nan Norman must have directed Easy to Love.
- The remaining director, Odette Olson, must have directed Amerigo.

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
Clue 1 states that of the film that grossed $5 million and the movie that grossed $8 million, one is Fast and Dead and the other was directed by Linda Lynch. This means Fast and Dead and Linda Lynch's movie are either $5 million or $8 million.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
Clue 2 states that Amerigo made 3 million less than Fast and Dead. Since Fast and Dead is either $5 million or $8 million, Amerigo must be either $2 million or $5 million.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
Clue 3 states that Amerigo is either the film that grossed $2 million or the film directed by Nan Norman. From Step 2, Amerigo could be $2 million or $5 million. If Amerigo is $2 million, it fits both conditions (earning and director). If Amerigo is $5 million, then it must be directed by Nan Norman.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
Clue 4 states that of the film directed by Hick Harmon and the film that grossed $8 million, one is Easy to Love and the other is Fast and Dead. Since Fast and Dead is either $5 million or $8 million, if Fast and Dead is $8 million, then Easy to Love must be directed by Hick Harmon and cannot be $8 million. If Fast and Dead is $5 million, then Easy to Love must be $8 million.

**Step 5: Deductions and Assignments**
- If Fast and Dead is $8 million, then Amerigo cannot be $5 million (from Step 2 and 3), so Amerigo must be $2 million and directed by Nan Norman.
- Linda Lynch must then direct the $5 million movie, which cannot be Fast and Dead or Amerigo, leaving What a World or Easy to Love. Since Easy to Love is either directed by Hick Harmon or is $8 million, Linda Lynch directs What a World.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- The team that made it to 135 ft was either the Flying Eyes or the contestants that used the hybrid sling.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 5
- Of the group that used the hybrid sling and the Russets, one scored a distance of 180 ft and the other scored a distance of 135 ft.
- Since 135 ft is either the Flying Eyes or the hybrid sling, and from Clue 5, the hybrid sling is either 135 ft or 180 ft, we can deduce that the hybrid sling must be at 135 ft, and the Russets must be at 180 ft.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The contestants that used the trebuchet was either the group that made it to 150 ft or the Flying Eyes.
- Since the Flying Eyes are not at 135 ft, they must be at one of the other distances. Since the Russets are at 180 ft, the Flying Eyes cannot be at 180 ft. Therefore, the Flying Eyes must be at 150 ft using the trebuchet.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The group that used the catapult landed 30 feet short of the team that used the slingshot.
- Since the distances are 135 ft, 150 ft, 165 ft, and 180 ft, the only way for one team to be 30 ft short of another is for the catapult to be at 135 ft and the slingshot to be at 165 ft.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 4
- The Spud Chuckers landed somewhat short of the Yukon Bolds.
- Since the Yukon Bolds are not mentioned in any other clue, and the only remaining distances are 165 ft and 180 ft, the Spud Chuckers must be at 165 ft and the Yukon Bolds at 180 ft.

Final Answer:
135 ft | Flying Eyes | Hybrid Sling

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3:
- Clue 1 states that the person with 84 LinkedIn connections is either the person with 150 Facebook friends or Vickie.
- Clue 3 states that of the one with 150 Facebook friends and the one with 130 Facebook friends, one is Yvonne and the other has 84 LinkedIn connections.

From these clues, we can deduce that:
- If Vickie is not the one with 150 Facebook friends, then she must be the one with 84 LinkedIn connections. Since the person with 150 Facebook friends also has 84 LinkedIn connections, Vickie must be the one with 150 Facebook friends and 84 LinkedIn connections.

Step 2: Apply Clue 2:
- Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari.
This means Danny and Kari must be assigned to the remaining Facebook friend counts of 140 and 120, respectively, since these are the only two numbers with a difference of 20.

Step 3: Apply Clue 4:
- The one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections.
Given the remaining Facebook friend counts (120 and 140), Danny must have 140 Facebook friends and 57 LinkedIn connections, and Kari must have 120 Facebook friends and 70 LinkedIn connections.

Step 4: Assign Yvonne:
- From Clue 3, Yvonne is either the one with 150 Facebook friends or 130 Facebook friends. Since Vickie is already assigned to 150 Facebook friends, Yvonne must have 130 Facebook friends.
- The only remaining LinkedIn connection count is 64, so Yvonne must have 64 LinkedIn connections.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1**: The Friambliss was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir.
   - This means Friambliss cannot be the latest vintage (1996) and must be 4 years older than whichever vintage is pinot noir.

2. **Clue 2**: The 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein.
   - This directly tells us that the 1996 wine is either syrah type or named Zifennwein.

3. **Clue 3**: The Ece Suss is either the 1992 bottle or the 1996 wine.
   - Ece Suss must be one of these two vintages.

4. **Clue 4**: Of the pinot gris and the 1984 wine, one is the Annata Branco and the other is the Friambliss.
   - This means either Annata Branco is 1984 and pinot gris, or Friambliss is 1984 and pinot gris.

5. **Clue 5**: The Zifennwein was bottled 4 years after the pinot gris.
   - This helps us determine the relative order of the Zifennwein and the pinot gris.

Based on these clues, let's assign:

- Since Friambliss is 4 years before the pinot noir, and considering the vintages available, if Friambliss is 1984, then the pinot noir must be 1988. This satisfies Clue 1.
- If Zifennwein is 1996 and it must be 4 years after the pinot gris (Clue 5), then pinot gris must be 1992.
- Since the 1996 wine is either syrah or Zifennwein (Clue 2), and Zifennwein is 1996, it must be syrah.
- Ece Suss must then be 1988, as it is the remaining option for Clue 3.
- This leaves Annata Branco as 1992 and pinot gris, which fits Clue 4.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: From Clue 3, Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau. This sets a relative member count between these two fraternities.

Step 2: From Clue 1, the fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau. This establishes a relationship between the fraternity on Boom Court and Alpha Beta Tau.

Step 3: From Clue 2, Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or the frat on Aspen Court. This gives us two possibilities for Tau Beta Pi.

Step 4: From Clue 4, of Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road, one has 23 members and the other has 29 members. This sets specific member counts for Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road.

Step 5: Since Tau Beta Pi is either 23 members or on Aspen Court, and considering Clue 4, if Tau Beta Pi has 29 members, it must be on Aspen Court. This leaves 23 members for Sigma Beta or the fraternity on Russell Road.

Step 6: Since Tau Beta Pi has 29 members and is on Aspen Court, Sigma Beta or the fraternity on Russell Road must have 23 members. Since Tau Beta Pi is not on Russell Road, Sigma Beta must be on Russell Road with 23 members.

Step 7: With Alpha Beta Tau and Beta Pi Omega left, and knowing from Clue 3 that Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau, and from Clue 1 that the fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau, we assign Alpha Beta Tau to 26 members and Beta Pi Omega to 32 members.

Step 8: Since Alpha Beta Tau has 26 members and the fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau, the fraternity on Boom Court must be the one with 23 members, which is Sigma Beta, not Alpha Beta Tau as previously stated.

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that of the K-9 unit assigned to Officer Yates and the canine that graduated in May, one was Jaws and the other was Hercules. This means Jaws and Hercules are either assigned to Yates or graduated in May, but not both.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that Aries graduated sometime after Jaws. This means Jaws cannot be in June, and Aries cannot be in May or earlier.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman. This sets a specific timeline between two dogs.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that the dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell. This means Tinkerbell cannot be in March, and the dog assigned to Fox cannot be in June.

**Step 5: Deductions and Assignments**
- Since Jaws cannot be in June (from Clue 2) and must be either with Yates or in May (from Clue 1), and considering Hercules must be the other option, we can start placing them. If Jaws is in May, Hercules cannot be in May and must be with Yates or vice versa. Let's assign Jaws to May and Hercules to Yates for now.
- Since Aries graduates after Jaws and cannot be in May, Aries must be in June.
- From Clue 3, since Nolan's dog graduated 2 months before Zimmerman's, and Aries (Zimmerman's dog) is in June, Nolan's dog must be in April. Since Hercules is assigned to Yates, Nolan's dog cannot be Hercules, so Nolan's dog must be Jaws. This contradicts our earlier placement, so we need to switch: Hercules in May, Jaws with Yates.
- From Clue 4, since Tinkerbell cannot be in March, and Fox's dog must be before Tinkerbell, Fox's dog must be in March. The only dog left for March is Tinkerbell, which contradicts Clue 4. Thus, Fox's dog must be another dog, and Tinkerbell must be in a later month. Since Hercules and Aries are placed, Tinkerbell must be in April, and Fox's dog, which is not Tinkerbell, must be in March.

**Final Answer:**
March | Jaws | Fox
April | Tinkerbell | Nolan
May | Hercules | Yates
June | Aries | Zimmerman

This arrangement satisfies all clues:
- Jaws is with Yates and Hercules is in May (Clue 1).
- Aries graduates after Jaws (Clue 2).
- Nolan's dog (Tinkerbell) graduated 2 months before Zimmerman's (Aries) (Clue 3).
- Fox's dog (Jaws) graduated before Tinkerbell (Clue 4).","March | Jaws | Yates
April | Aries | Nolan
May | Hercules | Fox
June | Tinkerbell | Zimmerman","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that of the K-9 unit assigned to Officer Yates and the canine that graduated in May, one was Jaws and the other was Hercules. This means Jaws and Hercules are either assigned to Yates or graduated in May, but not both.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that Aries graduated sometime after Jaws. This means Jaws cannot be in June, and Aries cannot be in May or earlier.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman. This sets a specific timeline between two dogs.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that the dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell. This means Tinkerbell cannot be in March, and the dog assigned to Fox cannot be in June.

**Step 5: Deductions and Assignments**
- Since Jaws cannot be in June (from Clue 2) and must be either with Yates or in May (from Clue 1), and considering Hercules must be the other option, we can start placing them. If Jaws is in May, Hercules cannot be in May and must be with Yates or vice versa. Let's assign Jaws to May and Hercules to Yates for now.
- Since Aries graduates after Jaws and cannot be in May, Aries must be in June.
- From Clue 3, since Nolan's dog graduated 2 months before Zimmerman's, and Aries (Zimmerman's dog) is in June, Nolan's dog must be in April. Since Hercules is assigned to Yates, Nolan's dog cannot be Hercules, so Nolan's dog must be Jaws. This contradicts our earlier placement, so we need to switch: Hercules in May, Jaws with Yates.

"**Step-by-Step Solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that the symposium event will involve 25 more people than Clarence's assignment. This means if Clarence handles an event with X attendees, the symposium will have X + 25 attendees.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that of the symposium job and the graduation assignment, one will be handled by Mabel and the other will have 125 attendees. This means either the symposium or the graduation will be handled by Mabel, and one of these events will have 125 attendees.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that the assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job. This means Mabel could be handling the 50 attendees event or it could be the conference.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 5**
- Clue 5 states that Patrice's assignment will involve 50 more people than the retreat assignment. This means if the retreat has X attendees, Patrice's event will have X + 50 attendees.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the retreat job will involve somewhat fewer people than the graduation job. This means the retreat has fewer attendees than the graduation.

**Step 6: Deduce from Clues**
- Since the symposium or graduation must have 125 attendees (from Clue 2), and the retreat has fewer attendees than the graduation (from Clue 3), the retreat cannot have 125 attendees. Therefore, the graduation must have 125 attendees.
- Since the graduation has 125 attendees and either symposium or graduation is handled by Mabel (from Clue 2), Mabel handles the graduation.

**Step 7: Further Deductions**
- Since Mabel handles the graduation with 125 attendees, the symposium must have 100 attendees (since 125 - 25 = 100, from Clue 1).
- Clarence cannot handle the symposium (from Clue 1), so Clarence must handle the 75 attendees event.
- Since the symposium has 100 attendees and is not handled by Mabel, it must be handled by Patrice (from Clue 5, and since Patrice's event has 50 more attendees than the retreat).

**Step 8: Assign Remaining Events and Planners**
- Since the retreat has fewer attendees than the graduation and cannot be 125 or 100, it must be 50 attendees (from Clue 3 and elimination).
- Since the assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job (from Clue 4), and Mabel is already assigned to the graduation, the 50 attendees event must be the conference.
- Glenda, being the only planner left, handles the retreat.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 4: The snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.**
   - Let's initially place the snail at $3.00 and see if any contradictions arise.

2. **Clue 1: The monkey cost more than the gold animal.**
   - Since the snail might be gold and costs $3.00, the monkey must cost more than $3.00. The next prices available are $4.00, $5.00, and $6.00.

3. **Clue 5: The yellow balloon cost 2 dollars less than the red balloon.**
   - We need to find pairs of prices where one is $2.00 less than the other. The pairs that work are $3.00 (yellow) and $5.00 (red), or $4.00 (yellow) and $6.00 (red).

4. **Clue 3: The dog cost 1 dollar more than the yellow piece.**
   - If the yellow balloon is $3.00, then the dog must be $4.00. If the yellow balloon is $4.00, then the dog must be $5.00. Since we placed the snail at $3.00, the yellow balloon cannot be $3.00. Thus, the yellow balloon is $4.00, and the dog is $5.00.

5. **Clue 2: Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red.**
   - Since we know the red balloon is $6.00, the cat must be the $6.00 balloon and is red. This leaves the monkey to be orange.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 1:
- Velma Vintz's book costs $10 less than Tara Tyne's book.
- The calculus book costs $5 more than Velma Vintz's book.
  This implies Velma's book is cheaper than both Tara's and the calculus book.

Step 2: From Clue 5, the pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99. Since Tara's book could be $39.99, and it's not the most expensive, it suggests that Tara's book might be the pre-calculus book at $39.99.

Step 3: From Clue 4, since Tara's book could be $39.99 and possibly pre-calculus, then Pat Peterson's book must be algebra. This leaves $34.99 and $29.99 for calculus and field theory.

Step 4: From Clue 3, field theory costs more than Mina Morton's book. If Mina's book is not the cheapest, it must be $29.99, making field theory $34.99.

Step 5: Assign Remaining Prices and Fields:
- With Tara Tyne at $39.99 (pre-calculus), Pat Peterson at algebra, and field theory at $34.99, calculus must be $29.99, and Velma Vintz's book must be $24.99.

Step 6: Assign Remaining Authors:
- Mina Morton's book must be calculus at $29.99. Velma Vintz's book, being the cheapest, is $24.99, and it must be the remaining field, which is algebra.

Final Answer:
$24.99 | algebra | Velma Vintz
$29.99 | calculus | Mina Morton
$34.99 | field theory | Pat Peterson
$39.99 | pre-calculus | Tara Tyne

This solution aligns with the clues provided and ensures that each author, field, and price is uniquely matched.","$24.99 | pre-calculus | Velma Vintz

1. From clue 1, Methuselah is 32 years old.
   - 32 | Methuselah | ?

2. From clue 2, the two rimmed tortoise is 36 years older than the horned tortoise. Since the ages available are 14, 32, 50, and 68, and the difference must be 36, the only possible ages for the horned and two rimmed tortoises are 14 and 50, or 32 and 68. Since Methuselah is 32 and not a species, the horned tortoise must be 14 and the two rimmed tortoise must be 50.
   - 14 | ? | horned
