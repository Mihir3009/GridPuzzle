"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze the clues related to the order of bottling.
- Clue 1 states that the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.
- Clue 5 states that the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.

From these clues, the order of bottling is: Annata Branco -> Ece Suss -> Bianca Flaux.

Step 2: Analyze the clues related to specific years and types.
- Clue 6 states that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.
- Clue 3 states that the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.

Step 3: Analyze the clues related to the difference in years.
- Clue 2 states that the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.

Step 4: Analyze the clues related to wine types.
- Clue 4 states that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.

Step 5: Assign the years to the wines based on the clues.
- Since the Bianca Flaux is bottled after the Ece Suss and 4 years before the Vendemmia, and considering the order from Step 1, the only possible years for Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia that fit the 4-year gap are 1992 for Bianca Flaux and 1996 for Vendemmia.
- Since the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir, and the only wine left for 1988 is Ece Suss, Ece Suss must be the 1988 pinot noir.
- Since the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer, and the only wine left for 1984 is Annata Branco, Annata Branco must be the 1984 gewurztraminer.
- The remaining type for 1992 Bianca Flaux is merlot, and for 1996 Vendemmia is riesling.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3
- Clue 1 states that the rose that won fourth place was Hannah's.
- Clue 3 states that the altissimo won fourth place.
From these clues, we can conclude that Hannah's rose is altissimo and it won fourth place.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- Clue 2 states that the flower that won second place, the calocarpa, and the bon silene were all different flowers.
Since we know altissimo is fourth, calocarpa and bon silene cannot be fourth. We need to determine which one is second.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5
- Clue 4 states that the bon silene finished 1 place ahead of Tricia's rose.
- Clue 5 states that the bon silene finished 2 places ahead of Nellie's flower.
From these clues, we can deduce the relative positions of bon silene, Tricia's rose, and Nellie's flower. If bon silene is 1 place ahead of Tricia and 2 places ahead of Nellie, then if bon silene is third, Tricia's rose would be fourth (which is not possible as Hannah's rose is fourth), and Nellie's rose would be fifth (which is not possible as there are only four places). Therefore, bon silene must be second, Tricia's rose third, and Nellie's rose fourth. But since Hannah's rose is fourth, Nellie's rose must be first.

Step 4: Determine the remaining placements and roses
- Since bon silene is second and altissimo is fourth, and calocarpa cannot be second (from Clue 2), calocarpa must be first.
- The only remaining rose for third place is perle d'or.

Step 5: Assign the remaining gardener to the remaining rose
- The only remaining gardener for the first place is Renee.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
- Galen scored 62%.
- Proclus scored 76%.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- The A.I. that scored 76% was either Galen or the system from Oxford.
- Since Proclus scored 76%, this means Proclus is the system from Oxford.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 5
- The system that scored 55% was either the system from CIT or Zeno.
- Since Zeno cannot be from CIT (as CIT is an institution and Zeno is an A.I.), Zeno must have scored 55%.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 1
- Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA.
- Since Zeno scored 55%, the system from UCLA must have scored 55% - 7% = 48%, but since 48% is not an option, we need to re-evaluate. 
- Since Zeno scored 55%, the next possible score for UCLA would be 62% + 7% = 69%. Therefore, the system from UCLA scored 69%.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Tracy's letter was sent in 1962.
  - This directly places Tracy in 1962.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- Sean's bottle was from Le Havre.
  - This assigns the origin of Sean's message to Le Havre.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Sean's missive is either the letter that was sent in 1983 or the message that was sent in 1962.
  - Since Tracy's letter is already in 1962, Sean's letter must be in 1983.
  - This places Sean in 1983 and confirms the origin of his letter as Le Havre.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- The message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg.
  - This means the Plymouth letter is 14 years after the Cherbourg letter.
  - We need to find suitable years that fit this 14-year gap.

**Step 5: Determine possible years for Plymouth and Cherbourg**
- Possible pairs for a 14-year difference are (1969, 1983) or (1976, 1990) but 1990 is not an option.
  - Thus, Cherbourg's letter must be from 1969 and Plymouth's from 1983.

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 3**
- The bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive.
  - Since Tracy's letter is from 1962, Karla's letter must be from Plymouth and thus from 1983.
  - This places Karla in 1983 with the origin Plymouth.

**Step 7: Remaining Assignments**
- With Tracy in 1962, Sean and Karla placed in 1983, the only remaining writer for 1969 and 1976 is Felipe and the remaining writer.
- Since Cherbourg is 1969 and Le Havre is 1983, the remaining origin for 1976 is Bournemouth.

**Step 8: Assign Remaining Writer**
- The remaining writer for 1969 is Felipe (Cherbourg) and for 1976 is the only one left, which must be Sean.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
- 1962 | Tracy | (not Cherbourg, not Plymouth, not Le Havre) - Remaining is Bournemouth
- 1969 | Felipe | Cherbourg
- 1976 | (Remaining writer) | (Remaining origin)
- 1983 | Karla | Plymouth

**Correction:**
- Sean is in 1983 with Le Havre (from Clue 5 and Clue 4).
- The remaining writer for 1976 is the only one left, which must be Karla, but Karla is already placed in 1983. Thus, the remaining writer for 1976 is Sean, which is incorrect as per previous assignment. This needs to be corrected.

**Corrected Final Answer:**
- 1962 | Tracy | Bournemouth
- 1969 | Felipe | Cherbourg
- 1976 | (Remaining writer) | (Remaining origin)
- 1983 | Sean | Le Havre

**Final Correction:**
- The remaining writer for 1976 is Karla, and the origin is Plymouth. However, Karla is in 1983. Thus, the remaining writer for 1976 is not Karla but the only one left, which is Sean. This is incorrect as per previous assignment. Thus, the remaining writer for 1976 is the only one left, which must be Karla, and the origin is Plymouth.","1962 | Tracy | Cherbourg

- The remaining writer for 1976 is the only one left, which must be Karla, but Karla is already placed in 1983. Thus, the remaining writer for 1976 is Sean, which is incorrect as per previous assignment. This needs to be corrected.

**Corrected Final Answer:**
- 1962 | Tracy | Bournemouth
- 1969 | Felipe | Cherbourg
- 1976 | (Remaining writer) | (Remaining origin)
- 1983 | Sean | Le Havre

**Final Correction:**
- The remaining writer for 1976 is Karla, and the origin is Plymouth. However, Karla is in 1983. Thus, the remaining writer for 1976 is not Karla but the only one left, which is Sean. This is incorrect as per previous assignment. Thus, the remaining writer for 1976 is the only one left, which must be Karla, and the origin is Plymouth.","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Tracy's letter was sent in 1962.
  - This directly places Tracy in 1962.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- Sean's bottle was from Le Havre.
  - This assigns the origin of Sean's message to Le Havre.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Sean's missive is either the letter that was sent in 1983 or the message that was sent in 1962.
  - Since Tracy's letter is already in 1962, Sean's letter must be in 1983.
  - This places Sean in 1983 and confirms the origin of his letter as Le Havre.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- The message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg.
  - This means the Plymouth letter is 14 years after the Cherbourg letter.
  - We need to find suitable years that fit this 14-year gap.

**Step 5: Determine possible years for Plymouth and Cherbourg**
- Possible pairs for a 14-year difference are (1969, 1983) or (1976, 1990) but 1990 is not an option.
  - Thus, Cherbourg's letter must be from 1969 and Plymouth's from 1983.

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 3**
- The bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive.
  - Since Tracy's letter is from 1962, Karla's letter must be from Plymouth and thus from 1983.
  - This places Karla in 1983 with the origin Plymouth.

**Step 7: Remaining Assignments**
- With Tracy in 1962, Sean and Karla placed in 1983, the only remaining writer for 1969 and 1976 is Felipe and the remaining writer.
- Since Cherbourg is 1969 and Le Havre is 1983, the remaining origin for 1976 is Bournemouth.

**Step 8: Assign Remaining Writer**
- The remaining writer for 1969 is Felipe (Cherbourg) and for 1976 is the only one left, which must be Sean.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
- 1962 | Tracy | (not Cherbourg, not Plymouth, not Le Havre) - Remaining is Bournemouth
- 1969 | Felipe | Cherbourg
- 1976 | (Remaining writer) | (Remaining origin)

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 3**
- Clue 2 states that the April 17 outing was in Gilmore City.
- Clue 3 states that the outing where they saw 16 shooting stars was in Gilmore City.

From these clues, we can conclude that on April 17 in Gilmore City, they saw 16 shooting stars.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that the April 10 outing logged 7 more shooting stars than the April 22 outing.

This clue helps us establish a relationship between the number of shooting stars seen on April 10 and April 22, but we need more information to assign specific numbers.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that the outing to Eastbrook logged 7 fewer shooting stars than the trip to Isleton.

This clue establishes a relationship between the number of shooting stars seen in Eastbrook and Isleton, but again, specific numbers are yet to be assigned.

**Step 4: Assign Remaining Dates and Locations**
- From Step 1, we know April 17 is taken by Gilmore City with 16 shooting stars.
- We need to assign the remaining dates (April 7, April 10, April 22) and locations (Eastbrook, Isleton, Manchester) to the remaining shooting star counts (2, 9, 23).

**Step 5: Apply Clue 4**
- Since April 10 has 7 more shooting stars than April 22, and we know the counts left are 2, 9, and 23, the only way to satisfy this with a difference of 7 is:
  - April 10 has 9 shooting stars, and April 22 has 2 shooting stars.

**Step 6: Apply Clue 1**
- Eastbrook has 7 fewer shooting stars than Isleton.
- With the remaining counts (2, 23), Eastbrook must have 2 shooting stars, and Isleton must have 9 shooting stars.

**Step 7: Assign Remaining Location**
- The only remaining location for the 23 shooting stars is Manchester.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Assign Underwood to room 114 based on Clue 1.**
- Underwood is in room 114.

**Step 2: Determine the stay duration of the guest in room 320 based on Clue 2.**
- Since the guest in room 320 stays 1 day fewer than Underwood, we need to determine Underwood's stay duration first. However, we don't have direct information about Underwood's stay, so we'll need to use other clues to infer this.

**Step 3: Assign Owens to a 3-day stay based on Clue 3.**
- Owens is staying for 3 days.

**Step 4: Determine Parker's stay duration based on Clue 4.**
- Parker stays 1 day longer than the guest in room 314. We need to find out how many days the guest in room 314 stays to determine Parker's stay.

**Step 5: Analyze the possible days for each guest and room.**
- Since Owens is staying for 3 days, and Parker stays longer than the guest in room 314, Parker cannot be staying for 2 days. Therefore, Parker must be staying for either 4 or 5 days.
- If Parker stays for 4 days, then the guest in room 314 stays for 3 days. If Parker stays for 5 days, then the guest in room 314 stays for 4 days.

**Step 6: Assign days to Underwood and the guest in room 320.**
- Since Underwood is in room 114 and the guest in room 320 stays 1 day fewer, if Underwood stays for 4 days, then the guest in room 320 stays for 3 days. If Underwood stays for 5 days, then the guest in room 320 stays for 4 days.

**Step 7: Finalize the assignments based on the remaining options and logical deductions.**
- If Owens is staying for 3 days, and the guest in room 320 also stays for 3 days, there is a conflict unless Owens is in room 320. However, we know from Clue 1 that Underwood is in room 114, not Owens.
- Therefore, Underwood must stay for 5 days, and the guest in room 320 stays for 4 days. This makes Parker stay for 5 days (since Parker stays longer than the guest in room 314), and the guest in room 314 stays for 4 days.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze the clues directly providing information about pounds lost.
- From Clue 3: Stuart lost 7 lbs.
- From Clue 5: Wesley lost 5 lbs.

Step 2: Use Clue 1 and Clue 3 to determine the pounds lost by the person on the vegan diet.
- Clue 1 states that Stuart lost 4 more pounds than the person who used the vegan diet.
- Since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet lost 7 - 4 = 3 lbs.

Step 3: Use Clue 2 to determine the pounds lost by the person on the gluten-free diet and identify Raymond's pounds lost.
- Clue 2 states that the dieter who used the gluten-free diet lost 2 more pounds than Raymond.
- Since the only remaining weights are 3, 5, and 9, and Wesley (5 lbs) and Stuart (7 lbs) are accounted for, Raymond must have lost either 3 lbs or 5 lbs. Since the vegan diet person lost 3 lbs and it's not Raymond (from Clue 4), Raymond must have lost 5 lbs.
- Therefore, the person on the gluten-free diet lost 5 + 2 = 7 lbs. But since Stuart lost 7 lbs and is not on the gluten-free diet (from Clue 4), this reasoning must be incorrect. Re-evaluate.

Step 4: Re-evaluate the pounds lost by Raymond and the gluten-free dieter.
- Since Raymond cannot have lost 3 lbs (vegan) or 7 lbs (Stuart), he must have lost 9 lbs.
- Therefore, the person on the gluten-free diet lost 9 + 2 = 11 lbs, which is not possible. Re-evaluate again.

Step 5: Re-evaluate the pounds lost by the gluten-free dieter.
- Since Raymond lost 9 lbs, the gluten-free dieter must have lost 9 - 2 = 7 lbs. This aligns with Stuart's weight loss, so Stuart is on the gluten-free diet.

Step 6: Assign the remaining diet.
- Wesley lost 5 lbs, and the only remaining pounds are 3 lbs for the vegan diet.
- The remaining diets are caveman and vegan. Since the vegan diet is associated with 3 lbs, and the caveman diet is not yet assigned, Tom must be on the caveman diet and lost 3 lbs.

Final Answer:
3 | Tom | caveman
5 | Wesley | dairy-free

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
Yvette's purchase was either the insect that sold for $45 or the peacock butterfly. This means Yvette either bought the $45 butterfly or the peacock butterfly.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
The swallowtail butterfly cost $15 more than Phillip's purchase. This clue will be used later when we have more information about Phillip's purchase.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
The atlas butterfly cost more than the peacock butterfly. This means the atlas butterfly cannot be the cheapest.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
The four butterflies were the butterfly that sold for $90, the grayling butterfly, Yvette's purchase, and Walter's purchase. This clue confirms that these are the only four categories we are dealing with.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clue 1 and Clue 4**
Since Yvette's purchase was either $45 or the peacock, and the atlas costs more than the peacock, the atlas cannot be $45. Therefore, if Yvette bought the peacock, it cannot be the cheapest or the most expensive ($90). 

**Step 6: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 5**
Since the atlas costs more than the peacock and cannot be the cheapest, it must be more than $45. The only options left are $60, $75, or $90. Since the swallowtail costs $15 more than Phillip's purchase, and the atlas is not the cheapest, let's assume Phillip bought the cheapest ($45) and the swallowtail is $60.

**Step 7: Assign prices**
- Phillip's purchase: $45
- Swallowtail: $60 (from Step 6)
- Since the atlas costs more than the peacock and the swallowtail is $60, the atlas must be $75 or $90. Since the peacock is not the cheapest or the most expensive, it must be $75, and the atlas is $90.

**Step 8: Assign remaining butterflies and winners**
- Yvette's purchase: Peacock ($75)
- Walter's purchase: Atlas ($90)
- Otis must then have the remaining butterfly, which is the grayling, and the remaining price, which is $45.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**
- Eugene will depart from Farley.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person departing from Farley (Eugene) will leave 2 days before the person departing from Hardwick.
- Since there are only four days (June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13), Eugene can only depart on June 10 or June 11 to allow a 2-day gap. If Eugene departs on June 12 or June 13, there wouldn't be enough days left for a 2-day gap.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- The conductor departing from Epworth will leave 1 day after Mitchell.
- This means Mitchell cannot depart on June 13, as there would be no day after June 13.

**Step 4: Combine Clues 1 and 4**
- If Eugene (departing from Farley) leaves on June 10, then the person from Hardwick would leave on June 12.
- If Eugene leaves on June 11, then the person from Hardwick would leave on June 13.
- Since Mitchell needs a day after him for the Epworth departure, Mitchell cannot leave on June 12 (if Eugene leaves on June 10) because that would mean Epworth departure would be on June 13, leaving no room for Hardwick departure on June 13.
- Therefore, Eugene leaves on June 11, Hardwick departure is on June 13, and Mitchell leaves on June 12 with Epworth departure on June 13.

**Step 5: Assign Remaining Days and Names**
- Eugene departs from Farley on June 11.
- Mitchell departs on June 12, and the next day (June 13) is the departure from Epworth.
- Hardwick departure is on June 13, but since Mitchell is already assigned to June 12 and Epworth, the remaining name for June 13 is Roderick.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- The person who played in 5 games last season is the quarterback.
  - This directly places the quarterback in game 5.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Kurt Koch is the defensive end.
  - This assigns Kurt Koch as the defensive end.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker.
  - Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end, we need to find his game number to determine the placekicker's game number.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- Edward Ellis played 2 more games than the defensive end.
  - This clue will help once we know which game the defensive end (Kurt Koch) played.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games last season.
  - This clue suggests that Gordon Gregg could be the running back or someone else who played in 4 games.

**Step 6: Assigning Games**
- Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end and Edward Ellis played 2 more games than him, and the quarterback (unknown player) played 5 games:
  - If Kurt Koch played 3 games, Edward Ellis would have played 5 games. But the quarterback is already in game 5.
  - If Kurt Koch played 4 games, Edward Ellis would have played 6 games. This fits without conflicts.

**Step 7: Placekicker's Game**
- From Step 6, Kurt Koch played 4 games. According to Clue 4, the placekicker played 2 more games than Kurt Koch, which means the placekicker played 6 games.

**Step 8: Remaining Player and Position**
- Jack Jensen must be the placekicker since he is the only player left for game 6.
- Gordon Gregg, by elimination and Clue 5, must be the running back and played in 3 games.

**Final Answer:**
- Fill the following table to show your final answer.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- Violet's pet is the boxer.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu.
  This means Kayla did not adopt the shih tzu and there are two months between the adoption of the shih tzu and Kayla's pet.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab.
  This means Rosie did not adopt the black lab and there is one month between the adoption of Rosie's pet and the black lab.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The four puppies are Rosie's pet, the dog adopted in April, the puppy adopted in February, and the puppy adopted in March.
  This clue confirms that all months had adoptions, and Rosie's pet is one of them.

Step 5: Deductions from Clues 2 and 3
- Since Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu, and Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab, we can start placing possible months for these pets.
- If the shih tzu was adopted in January, then Kayla's pet would be in March. But if the shih tzu was adopted in February, then Kayla's pet would be in April.

Step 6: Further Deductions
- Since Violet's pet is the boxer, and Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab, Rosie cannot have the boxer or the black lab. Therefore, Rosie must have either the schnauzer or the shih tzu.

Step 7: Placing Rosie
- If Rosie had the schnauzer, and considering the black lab was adopted a month after Rosie's pet, the black lab cannot be in January or February (as it needs a month after Rosie's pet). If Rosie's pet is in February (schnauzer), then the black lab would be in March.

Step 8: Placing Kayla and the Shih Tzu
- If the shih tzu was adopted in January, Kayla's adoption in March fits as it is 2 months after. This leaves April for the black lab, which fits with Rosie's pet being in February and the black lab being a month after.

Step 9: Final Placement
- Violet has the boxer, but the month is not yet determined. Since all other pets and months are placed, Violet with the boxer must be in January.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Gracie is 11 years old.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 12 years old.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The 11-year-old condor (Gracie) has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old bird.
- Since the 12-year-old condor has a wingspan of 114 inches, the 9-year-old cannot have this wingspan.
- Therefore, the 9-year-old must have a wingspan of 110 inches (114 - 4 = 110).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The 9-year-old condor is either the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches or Angel.
- Since the 9-year-old has a wingspan of 110 inches, the 9-year-old must be Angel.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clue 2**
- The four condors are the 9-year-old condor (Angel with 110 inches), the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches, Buddy, and the condor with a wingspan of 110 inches.
- Since Angel is the 9-year-old with 110 inches, Buddy must have a different wingspan and age.

**Step 6: Assign remaining wingspans and ages**
- We know:
  - 114 inches is 12 years old.
  - 110 inches is 9 years old (Angel).
  - 11 years old (Gracie) must have a wingspan of 106 inches (110 - 4 = 106).
- The remaining wingspan of 102 inches must be assigned to the remaining age, which is 8 years old.

**Step 7: Assign Buddy**
- Buddy is not 9 years old (Angel) or 11 years old (Gracie) or 12 years old (114 inches).
- Therefore, Buddy must be 8 years old with a wingspan of 102 inches.

"Step-by-step solution:

1. **Starting with Clue 2**: The Disty launched in March.
   - March | Disty | ?

2. **Using Clue 4**: The Iunsel is going to Pluto.
   - ? | Iunsel | Pluto

3. **Using Clue 5**: The Iunsel launched 1 month before the mission going to Uranus.
   - Since Iunsel is linked to Pluto, the mission to Uranus must be the month after Iunsel.

4. **Using Clue 1**: The Iunsel launched sometime after the probe going to Mercury.
   - This means the probe to Mercury must be launched before Iunsel.

5. **Using Clue 3**: The Moro Jaddo launched 1 month after the mission going to Uranus.
   - Since Moro Jaddo is exactly one month after Uranus, and Iunsel (Pluto) is one month before Uranus, we can start placing them.

6. **Placement of Iunsel and Uranus**:
   - Since Iunsel is after the Mercury mission and before Uranus, and Moro Jaddo is after Uranus, the only arrangement that fits all clues is:
     - January | ? | Mercury

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The four people mentioned are: the reporter on April 7th, the reporter who covered the solar eclipse, the journalist who covered the earthquake, and Randy Reid. This implies these are four different people.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Randy Reid left 1 day after the journalist who covered the solar eclipse. This means Randy Reid cannot be the reporter on April 7th, as there is no day after April 7th. Therefore, the solar eclipse must have been covered on April 6th, and Randy Reid reported on April 7th.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Linda Lott left 1 day before the journalist who covered the flooding. Since Randy Reid is on April 7th and not covering flooding, and the solar eclipse is on April 6th, Linda Lott must have left on April 5th. Therefore, flooding was covered on April 6th.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Sid Snyder left 1 day after Tam Terry. Since Randy Reid is on April 7th and Linda Lott is on April 5th, Tam Terry must be on April 4th, and Sid Snyder on April 5th.

**Step 5: Assign Remaining Stories**
- From Clue 1, the earthquake must be covered by someone other than Randy Reid, Sid Snyder, and the reporter on April 7th. Since flooding is on April 6th and solar eclipse on April 6th, the only remaining day for the earthquake is April 4th.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Reporters and Stories**
- Since Randy Reid is on April 7th, and Sid Snyder is on April 5th, the only remaining reporter for April 4th is Tam Terry. The remaining story for April 7th is the royal wedding.

- Elvira paid $6 less than the customer who got picked up at the Moore Mansion.
- Since the fares are $6.50, $9.50, $12.50, $15.50, and Della has $12.50, the only way Elvira could pay $6 less than another fare is if she paid $6.50 and the Moore Mansion fare was $12.50.

- Wayne is at Seattle Tower.
- Della has $12.50 fare.
- Elvira has $9.50 fare and the only remaining fare is $6.50 which must be for Isabel.
- Since Camlin Hotel and Seattle Tower are taken by the $15.50 fare and Wayne respectively, and Moore Mansion is linked with the $15.50 fare, the remaining pickup point for Isabel ($6.50 fare) is Neptune Theatre.

**Step 6: Assign remaining customer to remaining fare and pickup point**

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 5
- The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake.
- Since the bowling pin is already assigned to October 7 from Step 1, it must be Mrs. Ingram's cake.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
- Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 1
- Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car.
- Since Mrs. Nolan's cake is the sports car, and Mrs. Danielson's cake is delivered 1 day before, Mrs. Danielson's cake must be delivered on October 6 (assuming Mrs. Nolan's sports car cake is delivered on October 7, but we know from Step 1 that October 7 is the bowling pin).

Step 5: Analyze Clue 2
- The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake.
- Since Mrs. Ingram's cake is the bowling pin delivered on October 7, the turtle must be delivered on October 5.

Step 6: Assign Remaining Options
- We have assigned cakes for October 5 (turtle), October 7 (bowling pin, Mrs. Ingram), and Mrs. Nolan's cake (sports car).
- Mrs. Danielson's cake is 1 day before the sports car, which must be October 6.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- The nibner newt was recognized as endangered in 2006.
  Therefore, 2006 | nibner newt | unknown population

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- The nibner newt was listed 2 years before the species with a population size of 385.
  Since the nibner newt was listed in 2006, the species with a population of 385 must have been listed in 2008.
  Therefore, 2008 | unknown species | 385

Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
- The species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.
  Since 2008 has a population of 385, the species must be either perens pig or osbele oryx.
  Therefore, 2008 | perens pig or osbele oryx | 385

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The perens pig is either the animal added to the list in 2006 or the species with a population size of 315.
  Since 2006 is already occupied by the nibner newt, the perens pig must have a population of 315.
  Therefore, perens pig cannot be in 2008 as it has a population of 385. Thus, 2008 | osbele oryx | 385

Step 5: Place the perens pig
- From Step 4, perens pig has a population of 315, and it's not in 2006 or 2008.
  Therefore, 2007 | perens pig | 315

Step 6: Analyze Clue 5
- The perens pig was listed sometime before the species with a population size of 210.
  Since perens pig is in 2007, the species with a population of 210 must be in 2009.
  Therefore, 2009 | unknown species | 210

Step 7: Remaining species and population
- The remaining species are eldar elk and the remaining population is 280.
  Since 2006 and 2007 are occupied, and 2009 has a population of 210, the only year left for eldar elk with a population of 280 is 2009.
  Therefore, 2009 | eldar elk | 280

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The siren with a loudness of 105 decibels is either the siren released in 2009 or the Bradley X9.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- The siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009.
  - This implies the siren in 1999 has fewer decibels than the siren in 2009.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm.
  - If Bradley X9 is 105 decibels (from Clue 1), then Soundarm must be 95 decibels, but since 95 is not an option, Bradley X9 cannot be 105 decibels. Therefore, the siren in 2009 must be 105 decibels.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide.
  - This sets a relative scale between Soundarm and Rip Tide.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998.
  - This helps establish a relationship between Rip Tide and the 1998 siren.

**Step 6: Deduce from Clues 3, 4, and 5**
- If we assume Rip Tide is 100 decibels (the lowest available), then Soundarm would be 105 decibels. However, from Clue 1, the 105 decibels siren is in 2009, which conflicts with the Soundarm being 105 decibels. Therefore, Rip Tide cannot be 100 decibels.
- If Rip Tide is 105 decibels, Soundarm would be 110 decibels, and Bradley X9 would be 120 decibels, which is not possible. So, Rip Tide must be 95 decibels, which is also not possible as 95 is not an option.
- Therefore, Rip Tide must be 100 decibels, Soundarm 105 decibels, and Bradley X9 115 decibels.

**Step 7: Assign years based on decibels and remaining clues**
- Since Rip Tide is 100 decibels and 10 decibels quieter than the 1998 siren, the 1998 siren must be 110 decibels.
- Since the 2009 siren is 105 decibels, it must be the Soundarm.
- Since the Bradley X9 is 115 decibels, it must be the remaining year not yet used, which is 2007.
- The remaining siren, Securalert, must be 110 decibels and from 1998.

**Final Answer:**
```

   - If we assume Rip Tide is 100 decibels (the lowest available), then Soundarm would be 105 decibels. However, from Clue 1, the 105 decibels siren is in 2009, which conflicts with the Soundarm being 105 decibels. Therefore, Rip Tide cannot be 100 decibels.
   - If Rip Tide is 105 decibels, Soundarm would be 110 decibels, and Bradley X9 would be 120 decibels, which is not possible. So, Rip Tide must be 95 decibels, which is also not possible as 95 is not an option.
   - Therefore, Rip Tide must be 100 decibels, Soundarm 105 decibels, and Bradley X9 115 decibels.

7. Assign years based on decibels and remaining clues
   - Since Rip Tide is 100 decibels and 10 decibels quieter than the 1998 siren, the 1998 siren must be 110 decibels.
   - Since the 2009 siren is 105 decibels, it must be the Soundarm.
   - Since the Bradley X9 is 115 decibels, it must be the remaining year not yet used, which is 2007.
   - The remaining siren, Securalert, must be 110 decibels and from 1998.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Assign Henrietta's design based on clues 1 and 2.
- Henrietta's airplane went 35 feet and was silver.

Step 2: Determine Omar's airplane based on clue 3.
- Omar's airplane went farther than the silver airplane (which went 35 feet). The only distances farther than 35 feet are 45 feet. Therefore, Omar's airplane went 45 feet.

Step 3: Analyze clues 4 and 5 to determine the distances of the black and pink airplanes.
- Since the pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane, and Ella's design went 10 feet farther than the black plane, we need to find two distances that are 10 feet apart and include the remaining distances (15 feet and 25 feet). The only way to arrange this is to have the black plane at 15 feet and the pink plane at 25 feet. Consequently, Ella's airplane went 25 feet.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people are all different cultures.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Sameos culture was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people.
- This means Sameos was founded in 100 AD (since 350 AD + 250 years = 600 AD, and 600 AD is the only option left for 7,500 people).

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- The culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people.
- Since Sameos (100 AD) is not 5,000 people (as it is 250 years before 7,500 people), and 850 AD is a different culture from 4,500 people (from Clue 1), the only options left for 5,000 people are 350 AD or 600 AD. Since 600 AD is taken by 7,500 people, 350 AD must be 5,000 people.
- Therefore, 850 AD must be 9,500 people.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the culture with 4,500 people and the culture with 9,500 people, one was the Budel culture and the other was founded in 600 AD.
- Since 600 AD is taken by 7,500 people, 600 AD cannot be 4,500 or 9,500 people. Thus, 4,500 people must be Budel, and it must be at 100 AD (since 350 AD is 5,000 people and 850 AD is 9,500 people).

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 2**
- The culture with 9,500 people was founded sometime before the culture with 4,500 people.
- This confirms that 850 AD (9,500 people) is before 100 AD (4,500 people), which fits as 850 AD is indeed before 100 AD in the next cycle of counting.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Cultures**
- Cultures left are Hatgare and Oiracha. Since Oiracha is different from 850 AD and 4,500 people (Clue 1), and 850 AD is 9,500 people, Oiracha must be 350 AD (5,000 people).

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 2**
- The culture with 9,500 people was founded sometime before the culture with 4,500 people.
- This confirms that 850 AD (9,500 people) is before 100 AD (4,500 people), which fits as 850 AD is indeed before 100 AD in the next cycle of counting.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Cultures**
- Cultures left are Hatgare and Oiracha. Since Oiracha is different from 850 AD and 4,500 people (Clue 1), and 850 AD is 9,500 people, Oiracha must be 350 AD (5,000 people).
- Hatgare must then be 600 AD (7,500 people).

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**
- The comet discovered in 2009 is Casputi.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Wally Six is either the comet Tillman discovered or the comet discovered in 2009.
- Since Casputi was discovered in 2009 (from Step 1), Wally Six cannot be the comet discovered in 2009.
- Therefore, Wally Six must be the comet Tillman discovered.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of Trosny and Casputi, one was found in 2008 and the other was first seen by Hal Gregory.
- Since Casputi was discovered in 2009 (from Step 1), Trosny must be the comet found in 2008.
- Therefore, Hal Gregory must have discovered Casputi.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the comet discovered in 2010 and the one discovered in 2008, one is Wally Six and the other was first seen by Jack Ingram.
- Since Trosny was discovered in 2008 (from Step 3) and Wally Six was discovered by Tillman (from Step 2), Jack Ingram must have discovered the comet in 2010.
- Since Wally Six is not the comet discovered in 2008 or 2010, it must be the comet discovered in 2011 by Tillman.

**Step 5: Determine Remaining Comet and Astronomer**
- The remaining comet not yet assigned is Klionne.
- The remaining astronomer not yet assigned is Ken Jones.
- Since 2010 is the year Jack Ingram discovered a comet and Wally Six and Casputi are already assigned to other years, the comet discovered by Jack Ingram in 2010 must be Klionne.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Year**
- Ken Jones must be the astronomer for the remaining year, which is 2011.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 5
- The person who started in 2007 is Lyle Lucas.
  This directly places Lyle Lucas in 2007.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino.
  This directly links the superhero Ultra Hex to the real name Tim Trevino.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
- Of ""Ultra Hex"" and Peter Powers, one began his crusade in 2009 and the other in 2010.
  Since Ultra Hex is Tim Trevino, we can pair these years with either Tim Trevino or Peter Powers.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The hero who started in 2009 is either ""Criminal Bane"" or Peter Powers.
  Since Peter Powers is one of the options for 2009 or 2010 from Clue 4, and he is linked with either 2009 or 2010, we can confirm that Peter Powers started in 2009 or 2010, and the other option, ""Criminal Bane,"" must be the other year if not chosen for Peter Powers.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 1
- ""Green Avenger"" began 1 year before Peter Powers.
  If Peter Powers started in 2009, then Green Avenger must have started in 2008. If Peter Powers started in 2010, then Green Avenger must have started in 2009. Since Peter Powers or ""Criminal Bane"" must be in 2009 (from Clue 2), and ""Green Avenger"" cannot be in 2009 (as it would contradict Clue 1 with Peter Powers starting in 2010), it confirms that Peter Powers started in 2009 and Green Avenger in 2008.

- From the above steps, we know:
  - 2007: Lyle Lucas
  - 2008: Green Avenger

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign known years to windmills based on clues 2 and 3.**
- Grosmolen was built in 1729.
- Vlietmolen was built in 1706.

**Step 2: Analyze clue 1.**
- Of the windmill built in 1729 and the windmill built in 1683, one is owned by the De Vries family and the other is Doesmolen.
- Since Grosmolen was built in 1729, it must either be owned by the De Vries family or be Doesmolen. However, since Grosmolen is already identified as a windmill, it cannot be Doesmolen. Therefore, Grosmolen is owned by the De Vries family.
- Doesmolen was built in 1683.

**Step 3: Determine the remaining windmill and year.**
- The remaining windmills are Zemelmolen.
- The remaining years are 1752.
- Therefore, Zemelmolen was built in 1752.

**Step 4: Use clue 4 to determine the relationship between the Bakker and Meijer families.**
- The Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill.
- Since we know the years 1683, 1706, 1729, and 1752, the only possible 23-year gap is between 1729 and 1752.
- Therefore, the Meijer family's windmill was built in 1729, and the Bakker family's windmill was built in 1752.

**Step 5: Assign families to the remaining windmills.**
- Meijer family is associated with Grosmolen (1729).
- Bakker family is associated with Zemelmolen (1752).
- The remaining family, Van Dijk, must be associated with Vlietmolen (1706).

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

| Year | Windmill    | Family   |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1683 | Doesmolen   | De Vries |
| 1706 | Vlietmolen  | Van Dijk |
| 1729 | Grosmolen   | Meijer   |
| 1752 | Zemelmolen  | Bakker   |

This table correctly assigns each year to a windmill and a family based on the clues provided and logical deduction.","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign known years to windmills based on clues 2 and 3.**
- Grosmolen was built in 1729.
- Vlietmolen was built in 1706.

**Step 2: Analyze clue 1.**
- Of the windmill built in 1729 and the windmill built in 1683, one is owned by the De Vries family and the other is Doesmolen.
- Since Grosmolen was built in 1729, it must either be owned by the De Vries family or be Doesmolen. However, since Grosmolen is already identified as a windmill, it cannot be Doesmolen. Therefore, Grosmolen is owned by the De Vries family.
- Doesmolen was built in 1683.

**Step 3: Determine the remaining windmill and year.**
- The remaining windmills are Zemelmolen.
- The remaining years are 1752.
- Therefore, Zemelmolen was built in 1752.

**Step 4: Use clue 4 to determine the relationship between the Bakker and Meijer families.**
- The Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill.
- Since we know the years 1683, 1706, 1729, and 1752, the only possible 23-year gap is between 1729 and 1752.
- Therefore, the Meijer family's windmill was built in 1729, and the Bakker family's windmill was built in 1752.

**Step 5: Assign families to the remaining windmills.**
- Meijer family is associated with Grosmolen (1729).
- Bakker family is associated with Zemelmolen (1752).
- The remaining family, Van Dijk, must be associated with Vlietmolen (1706).

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5**
- Clue 4 states that Fushil was discovered sometime before Teuz.
- Clue 5 states that the island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm.

**Step 2: Deduce from Clue 1 and Clue 2**
- Clue 1 states that the island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Jujihm or Teuz.
- Clue 2 states that of the island on which the Holo'oka people lived and the island discovered in 1761, one was Fushil and the other was Teuz.

From Clue 2, since one of the islands is Fushil and the other is Teuz, and from Clue 1, since Holo'oka lived on either Jujihm or Teuz, it implies that Holo'oka lived on Teuz. Therefore, Teuz cannot be the island discovered in 1761, so Fushil was discovered in 1761.

**Step 3: Apply Clue 4**
- Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and Fushil was discovered before Teuz, Teuz must be discovered after 1761. The possible years for Teuz are 1768 or 1775.

**Step 4: Apply Clue 5**
- Since Hakili lived on an island discovered 7 years before Jujihm, we need to find the years that are 7 years apart. The possible pairs are (1754, 1761) and (1768, 1775). Since Fushil was discovered in 1761, Jujihm cannot be discovered in 1761. Therefore, if Hakili lived on an island discovered in 1768, Jujihm would be discovered in 1775.

**Step 5: Deduce Remaining Islands and Cultures**
- Since Hakili lived on the island discovered in 1768, and Fushil was discovered in 1761 with Holo'oka on Teuz, the remaining island for 1754 is Zafet.
- The remaining culture for Zafet in 1754 is Manika'i (from Clue 3, Hakili lived after Manika'i).

**Step 6: Assign the Remaining Culture to Fushil**
- The remaining culture for Fushil in 1761 is Kukani.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5**
- Clue 4 states that Fushil was discovered sometime before Teuz.
- Clue 5 states that the island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm.

**Step 2: Deduce from Clue 1 and Clue 2**
- Clue 1 states that the island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Jujihm or Teuz.
- Clue 2 states that of the island on which the Holo'oka people lived and the island discovered in 1761, one was Fushil and the other was Teuz.

From Clue 2, since one of the islands is Fushil and the other is Teuz, and from Clue 1, since Holo'oka lived on either Jujihm or Teuz, it implies that Holo'oka lived on Teuz. Therefore, Teuz cannot be the island discovered in 1761, so Fushil was discovered in 1761.

**Step 3: Apply Clue 4**
- Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and Fushil was discovered before Teuz, Teuz must be discovered after 1761. The possible years for Teuz are 1768 or 1775.

**Step 4: Apply Clue 5**
- Since Hakili lived on an island discovered 7 years before Jujihm, we need to find the years that are 7 years apart. The possible pairs are (1754, 1761) and (1768, 1775). Since Fushil was discovered in 1761, Jujihm cannot be discovered in 1761. Therefore, if Hakili lived on an island discovered in 1768, Jujihm would be discovered in 1775.

**Step 5: Deduce Remaining Islands and Cultures**
- Since Hakili lived on the island discovered in 1768, and Fushil was discovered in 1761 with Holo'oka on Teuz, the remaining island for 1754 is Zafet.
- The remaining culture for Zafet in 1754 is Manika'i (from Clue 3, Hakili lived after Manika'i).

**Step 6: Assign the Remaining Culture to Fushil**
- The remaining culture for Fushil in 1761 is Kukani.

5. **Deduce Remaining Islands and Cultures**
   - Since Hakili lived on the island discovered in 1768, and Fushil was discovered in 1761 with Holo'oka on Teuz, the remaining island for 1754 is Zafet.
   - The remaining culture for Zafet in 1754 is Manika'i (from Clue 3, Hakili lived after Manika'i).

6. **Assign the Remaining Culture to Fushil**
   - The remaining culture for Fushil in 1761 is Kukani.

### Final Answer:

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Assign known values from clues.
From clue 1, Gene paid $7.75.
From clue 4, Rosa asked for chia seeds.

Step 2: Analyze clue 2.
Rosa paid 1 dollar more than the person who requested ginger. Since Rosa paid $1 more than the person with ginger, and the prices are $6.75, $7.75, $8.75, $9.75, Rosa must have paid either $7.75 or $8.75 or $9.75. Since Gene paid $7.75, Rosa did not pay $7.75. Therefore, Rosa paid either $8.75 or $9.75.

Step 3: Analyze clue 3.
Of the person who requested acai berries and the customer who requested ginger, one paid $8.75 and the other is Delores. Since Rosa paid more than the person with ginger, the person with ginger must have paid $8.75 or less. Since Gene paid $7.75 and is not associated with ginger (from the given clues), the person with ginger must have paid $6.75 or $8.75. Since one of them is Delores and Delores cannot be Rosa (who had chia seeds), Delores must be the one who requested either acai berries or ginger.

Step 4: Determine Rosa's exact payment.
Since Rosa paid $1 more than the person with ginger and the person with ginger could only have paid $6.75 or $8.75, and since Rosa must pay more than $7.75 (Gene's payment), Rosa must have paid $9.75. Therefore, the person with ginger paid $8.75.

Step 5: Assign Delores.
Since Delores is either the one who requested acai berries or ginger, and the person with ginger paid $8.75, Delores must be the one who requested ginger.

Step 6: Assign remaining prices and superfoods.
Gene paid $7.75, and the remaining superfoods for him are acai berries or kale. Since Delores requested ginger and Rosa requested chia seeds, the remaining superfood for Gene is kale (since acai berries and ginger are taken by Delores). Betsy, the remaining customer, must have requested acai berries and paid $6.75.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$6.75 | Betsy | acai berries

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**
- The computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's computer.
- This implies that Victor's computer must have a hard drive larger than the smallest available, which is 128 GB. Therefore, Victor cannot have the 128 GB hard drive.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4**
- The computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM.
- Since the smallest increment available is 256 GB, the computer with 1 GB of RAM cannot have the 512 GB hard drive (as there is no 768 GB option).

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- The computer with 256 GB of hard drive space is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM.
- This means Otis does not have the 128 GB, 384 GB, or 512 GB hard drives.

**Step 4: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 4**
- If the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's, and the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM, we can start placing possible values:
  - If 1 GB of RAM has 128 GB, then 4 GB of RAM has 384 GB (128 + 256).
  - Victor must then have either 384 GB or 512 GB.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clue 2**
- The computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is somewhat smaller than Alejandro's build.
- Since 12 GB of RAM cannot have the smallest hard drive (128 GB), and it is smaller than Alejandro's, Alejandro must have one of the larger drives.

**Step 6: Deduce from Clue 1**
- Jack's computer is either the system with 256 GB of hard drive space or the build with 4 GB of RAM.
- Since we know the computer with 4 GB of RAM has 384 GB, Jack must have either 256 GB or 384 GB.

**Step 7: Final Placement**
- Since the computer with 256 GB is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM, and Jack's computer is either 256 GB or 384 GB, Jack must have 384 GB with 4 GB of RAM.
- Otis then has 256 GB with 12 GB of RAM.
- Victor cannot have 128 GB, so he must have 512 GB.
- Alejandro then has 128 GB.

- If the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's, and the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM, we can start placing possible values:
  - If 1 GB of RAM has 128 GB, then 4 GB of RAM has 384 GB (128 + 256).
  - Victor must then have either 384 GB or 512 GB.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clue 2**
- The computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is somewhat smaller than Alejandro's build.
- Since 12 GB of RAM cannot have the smallest hard drive (128 GB), and it is smaller than Alejandro's, Alejandro must have one of the larger drives.

**Step 6: Deduce from Clue 1**
- Jack's computer is either the system with 256 GB of hard drive space or the build with 4 GB of RAM.
- Since we know the computer with 4 GB of RAM has 384 GB, Jack must have either 256 GB or 384 GB.

**Step 7: Final Placement**
- Since the computer with 256 GB is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM, and Jack's computer is either 256 GB or 384 GB, Jack must have 384 GB with 4 GB of RAM.
- Otis then has 256 GB with 12 GB of RAM.
- Victor cannot have 128 GB, so he must have 512 GB.
- Alejandro then has 128 GB.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Harry is the musician.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Dale has a birthday 1 month after Harry.
- Since we don't know Harry's birthday yet, we can't determine Dale's birthday directly. We need to keep this relationship in mind.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Adrian has a birthday 1 month after the surgeon.
- This clue also depends on knowing the surgeon's birthday, which we don't know yet.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The architect has a birthday 2 months after the surgeon.
- This clue also depends on the surgeon's birthday.

**Step 5: Deduce the surgeon's birthday**
- Since the architect's birthday is 2 months after the surgeon and Adrian's birthday is 1 month after the surgeon, the surgeon must have one of the earlier birthdays to allow for these intervals.
- Possible birthdays for the surgeon are April 13th or May 18th. If the surgeon's birthday is April 13th, then Adrian's birthday would be May 18th, and the architect's birthday would be June 14th. This setup allows Dale to be July 16th, which is 1 month after Harry's June 14th birthday.

**Step 6: Assign careers based on birthdays**
- If the surgeon is April 13th, Adrian (May 18th) and the architect (June 14th) follow logically. Dale's birthday would then be July 16th, which fits the clue that Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's.

**Step 7: Assign remaining names and careers**
- Harry is the musician, and if his birthday is June 14th, then Dale's birthday being July 16th fits.
- The remaining career for April 13th (surgeon) would be Lamar, as all other names and careers are assigned logically.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The alligator that is 14.0 feet long is either the 20-year-old alligator or Arthur.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the animal that is 12.0 feet long and Carlos, one is 20 years old and the other is 10 years old.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- Iggy is 10 years younger than the animal that is 14.0 feet long.
- Since the 14.0 feet long alligator could be 20 years old (from Clue 1), Iggy must be 10 years old.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The alligator that is 11.5 feet long is 5 years younger than Carlos.
- Since Carlos is either 20 or 10 years old (from Clue 3), and the 11.5 feet long alligator is younger, Carlos must be 15 years old and the 11.5 feet long alligator is 10 years old. This contradicts the age of Iggy from Step 3, so Carlos must be 20 years old and the 11.5 feet long alligator is 15 years old.

**Step 5: Re-evaluate Clue 3 with new information**
- Carlos is 20 years old and not 12.0 feet long, so the 12.0 feet long alligator must be 10 years old.

**Step 6: Re-evaluate Clue 1 with new information**
- Since Carlos is 20 years old and not Arthur, Arthur must be the 14.0 feet long alligator.

**Step 7: Determine remaining names and lengths**
- Iggy is 10 years old and 12.0 feet long (from Step 5).
- Carlos is 20 years old, and we know from Clue 2 that the 11.5 feet long alligator is younger than Arthur, so Carlos cannot be 11.5 feet long. Thus, Carlos must be 13.6 feet long.
- Sparky is the remaining name and must be 11.5 feet long and 15 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

10 | Iggy | 12.0 feet
15 | Sparky | 11.5 feet
20 | Carlos | 13.6 feet

Arthur is 14.0 feet long and 20 years old, but since Carlos is also 20 years old, there seems to be a contradiction. Let's re-evaluate:

- Arthur is 14.0 feet long.
- Carlos is 20 years old and 13.6 feet long.
- Iggy is 10 years old and 12.0 feet long.
- Sparky is 15 years old and 11.5 feet long.

Thus, Arthur must be the remaining age, which is 20 years old, matching the clue that the 14.0 feet long alligator is either 20 years old or Arthur. This resolves the contradiction.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The letter sent in 1962 was from Torquay.
  - 1962 | ? | Torquay

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- George's message was sent in 1969.
  - 1969 | George | ?

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Of the letter from Brighton and the missive that was sent in 1976, one is George's and the other is Karla's.
  - Since George's message was sent in 1969, Karla's message must be the one sent in 1976.
  - 1976 | Karla | ?
  - Since the only other option for the origin in Clue 3 is Brighton, and George's origin is not yet determined, Brighton cannot be the origin for 1969 or 1976. 

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- Tracy's message, the bottle that was sent in 1983, and the message from Penzance are all different letters.
  - 1983 | Tracy | ?
  - Since Penzance is different from the 1983 message, it cannot be the origin for Tracy's message.

- From clue 4: Dustin's trip starts at Casa Loma.

Step 2: Analyze the clues involving relationships between times, guides, and locations.
- From clue 2: Faye's outing is 1 hour before Kelly's. This means Faye could be at 7:00am or 8:00am, and Kelly would then be at 8:00am or 9:00am respectively. However, since 9:00am is already taken by the Greektown tour, Faye must be at 7:00am and Kelly at 8:00am.

Step 3: Apply clue 3 to determine the correct assignments for Janice and the 7:00am tour.
- Clue 3 states that one of the tours at Greektown or High Park is with Janice and the other is at 7:00am. Since Greektown is at 9:00am with Janice, the 7:00am tour must be at High Park.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
- This means Ellen did not buy her pet in January or February, and the macaw must have been bought in January or February.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
- From Step 1, if the macaw was bought in January, then Gladys's pet was bought in February, or vice versa.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet.
- If Gladys's pet was in February, Alberta's pet must be in January. If Gladys's pet was in January, Alberta's pet must be in December (which is not possible as per the given months). Therefore, Gladys's pet is in February and Alberta's pet is in January.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 3**
- The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.
- Since January and February are occupied by Alberta and Gladys, the finch and parakeet must be in March and April respectively.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird.
- Since the finch is in March, the lovebird must be in February.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Birds**
- Alberta's pet in January cannot be the macaw (as it's either in January or February and Gladys or the macaw is in February). Since the lovebird is in February, Alberta must have the remaining bird which is not the finch or lovebird. Therefore, Alberta has the macaw in January.
- Gladys has the lovebird in February.
- Ellen, by elimination and Clue 2, must have the parakeet in April.

**Step 7: Assign Remaining Name**
- Della is the only name left, so she must have the finch in March.

- Since heights are 144 ft., 147 ft., 150 ft., 153 ft., and Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than another tree, the 94 year-old tree cannot be 153 ft. tall (as there is no 156 ft. option). Therefore, the 94 year-old tree must be 147 ft. or less.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of The Senator and Marsh Tree, one is 85 years old and the other is 153 ft. tall.
- Since Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94 year-old tree, it cannot be 94 years old. Therefore, Marsh Tree must be 153 ft. tall or 85 years old.

**Step 4: Combine Clues 1 and 3**
- The Senator is taller than the 96 year-old tree.
- Since The Senator is either 85 years old or 153 ft. tall, and Marsh Tree is 153 ft. tall, The Senator must be 85 years old.
- Since The Senator is taller than the 96 year-old tree, the 96 year-old tree must be shorter than 153 ft. The only options left for the 96 year-old tree are 144 ft. and 150 ft.

**Step 5: Deduce from remaining options**
- Since Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall, and Marsh Tree is 153 ft. tall, the remaining heights for the 96 year-old tree are 144 ft. and 150 ft.
- Since The Senator is 85 years old and taller than the 96 year-old tree, the 96 year-old tree must be 144 ft. tall.
- The only remaining tree is Evan's Fir, and the only remaining height and age are 150 ft. and 94 years old.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that one of the cameras made by Banion or Honwa is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550.
- Since we don't know which one costs $550 yet, we'll keep this information in mind for further analysis.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that the camera made by Banion costs $25 more than the DM-5000.
- This implies that the DM-5000 must be priced at one of the available prices minus $25. Since the prices are $550, $575, $600, $625, the only prices that work for DM-5000 after subtracting $25 are $525, $550, $575, $600. Since $525 is not an option, DM-5000 must be either $550, $575, or $600.

**Step 3: Combine Clue 1 and Clue 2**
- If Banion's camera costs $25 more than the DM-5000 and could be either $575, $600, or $625, and one of Banion or Honwa's cameras costs $550, it cannot be Banion's camera that costs $550.
- Therefore, Honwa's camera costs $550.

**Step 4: Further deduction from Clue 2**
- Since Honwa's camera costs $550, by Clue 2, Banion's camera must be the Tela G5.
- Since Banion's camera costs $25 more than the DM-5000, and it cannot be $550, the only options left are $575, $600, $625. 

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the FC-520 costs $50 more than the model made by Cober.
- Since we know the prices are $550, $575, $600, $625, Cober's camera must be priced at $500, $525, $550, or $575 to allow for a $50 increase. Since $500 and $525 are not options, Cober's camera must be either $550 or $575.

**Step 6: Finalize the prices**
- Since Honwa's camera costs $550 and it cannot be Cober's camera, Cober's camera must cost $575.
- Therefore, FC-520 costs $625 ($575 + $50).
- Since Banion's camera is the Tela G5 and costs $25 more than the DM-5000, and cannot be $550 or $575, it must be $600.
- Therefore, DM-5000 costs $575.

**Step 7: Assign remaining camera and company**
- The only remaining camera is G-290 and the only remaining company is Dayero.
- Since all other prices and matches are made, Dayero's G-290 must cost $550.

   - Lectra 6 (Lirios) costs $625 (since it's $25 more than Torvia's model).

8. **Remaining assignments**:
   - The only remaining camera is DM-5000 and the only remaining company is Dayero.
   - Dayero -> DM-5000

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$550 | Torvia | Zenix 2C
$575 | Nectron | Tela G5
$600 | Dayero | DM-5000
$625 | Lirios | Lectra 6

This assignment satisfies all the clues:
- Clue 1 and 4 directly match.
- Clue 2 and 5 are satisfied by the price hierarchy and differences.
- Clue 3 is satisfied as Torvia and Nectron are assigned correctly with respect to Tela G5 and the $550 price.","1. **Clue 4**: The camera made by Lirios is the Lectra 6.
   - Lirios -> Lectra 6

2. **Clue 3**: Of the camera made by Torvia and the model made by Nectron, one is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550.
   - Since one of these cameras costs $550 and the other is Tela G5, we need to determine which is which. We will resolve this as we gather more information.

3. **Clue 5**: The Tela G5 costs 25 dollars more than the Zenix 2C.
   - This sets a relative price difference between Tela G5 and Zenix 2C.

4. **Clue 1**: The camera made by Lirios costs 25 dollars more than the model made by Torvia.
   - Since Lirios -> Lectra 6, and it costs $25 more than Torvia's model, we need to find the price of Torvia's model to determine the price of Lectra 6.

5. **Clue 2**: The Zenix 2C costs more than the model made by Torvia.
   - This indicates that Zenix 2C is priced higher than Torvia's camera.

6. **Using Clues 3 and 5**: If Tela G5 costs $25 more than Zenix 2C and Zenix 2C costs more than Torvia's model, we can start assigning possible prices:
   - If Torvia's model is the one costing $550 (from Clue 3), then Zenix 2C cannot be the lowest price since it costs more than Torvia's model. Therefore, Zenix 2C must be at least $575.
   - Since Tela G5 costs $25 more than Zenix 2C, if Zenix 2C is $575, Tela G5 would be $600.

7. **Assigning prices**:
   - Torvia's model costs $550.
   - Zenix 2C costs $575.
   - Tela G5 costs $600.
   - Lectra 6 (Lirios) costs $625 (since it's $25 more than Torvia's model).

8. **Remaining assignments**:
   - The only remaining camera is DM-5000 and the only remaining company is Dayero.
   - Dayero -> DM-5000

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- Elsie's canine won in 2008.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 5
- The beagle won 2 years before the pekingese.
- Since the beagle won 2 years before the pekingese, if the beagle won in 2006, the pekingese won in 2008. But from Clue 3, Elsie's dog won in 2008, so the beagle cannot have won in 2006. Therefore, the beagle won in 2007 and the pekingese in 2009.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The canine that won in 2006, the beagle, and the maltese are all different dogs.
- Since the beagle won in 2007 and the pekingese in 2009, the dog that won in 2006 is neither the beagle nor the pekingese. It must be the maltese.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- Of the canine that won in 2009 and the dog that won in 2006, one is the pekingese and the other is Fernando's.
- Since the pekingese won in 2009, Fernando's dog must be the one that won in 2006, which is the maltese.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 2
- Chester's canine is either the canine that won in 2006 or the beagle.
- Since Fernando's dog won in 2006 and it is the maltese, Chester's dog must be the beagle, which won in 2007.

Step 6: Assign Remaining Owner and Breed
- Owners left: Barbara

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- The March account and the sighting at Laurel Grove were different events.
This means that the sighting at Laurel Grove did not occur in March.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- Of the sighting at Laurel Grove and Francis's account, one happened in March and the other happened in May.
Since Laurel Grove did not occur in March (from Step 1), Laurel Grove must have occurred in May and Francis's account must have occurred in March.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 5
- The sighting at Seryl Forest was either Wanda's event or the June event.
This clue suggests two possibilities: Seryl Forest in June or Wanda's event at Seryl Forest.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- Hannah's event took place 2 months after the account at Seryl Forest.
If Seryl Forest was in June (from Step 3), Hannah's event would be in August, which is not a valid month. Therefore, Seryl Forest must have occurred in April, and Hannah's event must have occurred in June.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 4
- The account at Juniper Springs was either the April sighting or Hannah's sighting.
Since Hannah's event is in June (from Step 4), Juniper Springs must be Hannah's sighting in June.

Step 6: Deduce Remaining Information
- From the above steps, we know:
  - March: Francis's account
  - April: Seryl Forest sighting
  - May: Laurel Grove sighting
  - June: Hannah's sighting at Juniper Springs
- Wanda's event must be the remaining month and location. Since Seryl Forest in April and Juniper Springs in June are taken, and Laurel Grove in May is taken, Wanda's event must be in March at Bald Hill Run.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Peggy was born 6 minutes before the Underwoods' baby.
  - This means Peggy must have been born at 12:01am, and the Underwoods' baby at 12:07am.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- The four babies were Maxine, the child born at 12:10am, the Blanchards' baby, and the baby born at 12:07am.
  - Since the Underwoods' baby was born at 12:07am, this baby cannot be Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
  - Therefore, the baby born at 12:10am must be either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the Ortegas' child and the baby born at 12:10am, one was Luis and the other was Susan.
  - Since the baby born at 12:10am is either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby, it cannot be Luis or Susan.
  - Therefore, the Ortegas' baby must be either Luis or Susan and not born at 12:10am.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- The Ortegas' baby was either Susan or the child born at 12:04am.
  - From Step 3, the Ortegas' baby is either Luis or Susan.
  - If the Ortegas' baby is Susan, then she must be born at 12:04am.
  - If the Ortegas' baby is Luis, then Susan must be born at 12:10am, but this contradicts Clue 4 where the baby born at 12:10am is either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
  - Therefore, Susan is the Ortegas' baby born at 12:04am.

**Step 5: Deduce Remaining Information**
- Peggy was born at 12:01am, Susan at 12:04am, and the Underwoods' baby at 12:07am.
- The baby born at 12:10am must be Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
- Since the Underwoods' baby is at 12:07am, the Blanchards' baby must be Maxine born at 12:10am.
- The remaining baby, Luis, must be born at 12:07am.

- The four babies were Maxine, the child born at 12:10am, the Blanchards' baby, and the baby born at 12:07am.
  - Since the Underwoods' baby was born at 12:07am, this baby cannot be Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
  - Therefore, the baby born at 12:10am must be either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the Ortegas' child and the baby born at 12:10am, one was Luis and the other was Susan.
  - Since the baby born at 12:10am is either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby, it cannot be Luis or Susan.
  - Therefore, the Ortegas' baby must be either Luis or Susan and not born at 12:10am.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- The Ortegas' baby was either Susan or the child born at 12:04am.
  - From Step 3, the Ortegas' baby is either Luis or Susan.
  - If the Ortegas' baby is Susan, then she must be born at 12:04am.
  - If the Ortegas' baby is Luis, then Susan must be born at 12:10am, but this contradicts Clue 4 where the baby born at 12:10am is either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
  - Therefore, Susan is the Ortegas' baby born at 12:04am.

**Step 5: Deduce Remaining Information**
- Peggy was born at 12:01am, Susan at 12:04am, and the Underwoods' baby at 12:07am.
- The baby born at 12:10am must be Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
- Since the Underwoods' baby is at 12:07am, the Blanchards' baby must be Maxine born at 12:10am.
- The remaining baby, Luis, must be born at 12:07am.

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 5**
Fushil was either discovered in 1768 or 1754. This means Fushil cannot be associated with 1761 or 1775.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk. This means if we assign a year to Verinya, Nuhirk must be exactly 7 years later. The possible pairs are (1754, 1761) and (1768, 1775).

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
Of the island on which the Kukani people lived and the island on which the Wainani people lived, one was discovered in 1761 and the other was Nuhirk. Since Nuhirk can only be 1761 or 1775 (from Step 2), and one of these or 1761 must be where Kukani or Wainani lived, we can deduce that if Nuhirk is 1775, then the island discovered in 1761 must be associated with either Kukani or Wainani.

**Step 4: Combine Clues 2 and 3**
If Verinya was discovered in 1768, then Nuhirk was discovered in 1775. This fits with Clue 2, where one of the islands (Nuhirk or the one discovered in 1761) must be associated with Kukani or Wainani. Thus, Verinya is 1768 and Nuhirk is 1775.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 1**
Zafet was either the island on which the Kukani people lived or the island on which the Manika'i people lived. Since we know from Clue 2 that Kukani or Wainani must be associated with 1761 or Nuhirk (1775), and Zafet is neither of these years, Zafet must be associated with Manika'i.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Years**
From Step 1, Fushil was either 1768 or 1754. Since Verinya is 1768, Fushil must be 1754. The remaining year, 1761, must then be associated with the remaining island, which is not yet used, and from Clue 2, it must be associated with either Kukani or Wainani.

**Step 7: Finalize Assignments**
- Fushil (1754) cannot be Kukani or Wainani (from Clue 2), so it must be Enakai.
- Verinya (1768) cannot be Kukani or Wainani (from Clue 2), so it must be Manika'i.
- Nuhirk (1775) must be Wainani (since Kukani is left for 1761).
- Zafet (1761) must be Kukani (from Clue 1).

Final Answer:
1754 | Fushil | Enakai

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze the clues
- Clue 3 states that Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka. This means they cannot be in March and June respectively, as there is no month before March and no month after June.

Step 2: Apply Clue 4
- Clue 4 states that of Peter Parka and the application released in May, one was made by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo. Since we don't know which is which yet, we keep this in mind for cross-referencing with other clues.

Step 3: Apply Clue 2
- Clue 2 states that Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic. This means Apptastic's app cannot be in June, as there is no month after June.

Step 4: Apply Clue 1
- Clue 1 states that Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez, and the game released in May are all different apps. This means Vitalinks cannot be the game released in May and cannot be developed by BeGamez in May.

Step 5: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 2
- Since Angry Ants is released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka, and Wizard World is released 1 month after Apptastic's app, we can start placing them:
  - If Angry Ants is in March, Peter Parka must be in April.
  - If Apptastic's app is in April (Peter Parka or another), Wizard World must be in May.

Step 6: Apply Clue 4 with the above deductions
- Since Peter Parka is in April and Wizard World is in May, and one of them is developed by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo, and knowing from Clue 2 that Wizard World comes after Apptastic's app, it follows:
  - Apptastic developed the app in April (Peter Parka), and Gadingo developed Wizard World in May.

Step 7: Place remaining game and developer
- With Angry Ants in March, Peter Parka (Apptastic) in April, Wizard World (Gadingo) in May, the remaining month is June, and the remaining game and developer are Vitalinks and BeGamez.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
- Charlie Group deployed 1 hour before India Group.
This means Charlie cannot be at the latest time (11:00am) and India cannot be at the earliest time (8:00am).

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- Charlie Group is either the squad that jumped at 8:00am or the squad that dropped at Ezra Forest.
Since Charlie cannot be at 11:00am and must be 1 hour before India, Charlie can only be at 8:00am or 10:00am. But since India cannot be at 8:00am, Charlie must be at 8:00am.

Step 3: Place Charlie Group
- Charlie Group is at 8:00am.
This leaves the location for Charlie Group to be determined between Ezra Forest and others.

Since Charlie is at 8:00am, India must be at 10:00am (from Clue 4). This means Foxtrot cannot be at 10:00am and must be at Anthon Ridge.

Step 5: Place India Group
- India Group is at 10:00am.
This means the location at 10:00am cannot be Anthon Ridge (Foxtrot is there) and must be Crestline X (from Clue 3).

Step 6: Place Foxtrot Group
- Foxtrot Group is at Anthon Ridge.
This leaves the time for Foxtrot to be determined.

Step 7: Deduce Remaining Slots
- Since India is at 10:00am and Charlie is at 8:00am, Foxtrot must be at 9:00am.
- Whiskey Group is the only team left, so they must be at 11:00am.

Step 8: Deduce Remaining Locations
- Locations left are Ezra Forest and Frazier Park.
- Since Charlie is either at 8:00am or Ezra Forest (from Clue 1) and Charlie is at 8:00am, Charlie must be at Ezra Forest.
- This leaves Frazier Park for Whiskey Group at 11:00am.

Final Answer:
8:00am | Charlie | Ezra Forest

10:00am | Foxtrot | Crestline X
11:00am | Whiskey | Ezra Forest","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
- Charlie Group deployed 1 hour before India Group.
This means Charlie cannot be at the latest time (11:00am) and India cannot be at the earliest time (8:00am).

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- Charlie Group is either the squad that jumped at 8:00am or the squad that dropped at Ezra Forest.
Since Charlie cannot be at 11:00am and must be 1 hour before India, Charlie can only be at 8:00am or 10:00am. But since India cannot be at 8:00am, Charlie must be at 8:00am.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
Wendell Orr was either the sailor who finished in 270 days or the person in the gaff cutter.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
Of Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop, one finished in 270 days and the other finished in 278 days.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
Tara Carroll took 4 more days to finish than Ed Alexander.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
The sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days to finish than Ed Alexander.

**Step 5: Deductions from Clues 3 and 4**
If the sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days than Ed Alexander, and Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed Alexander, then:
- If Ed Alexander took x days, Tara Carroll took x + 4 days, and the sailor in the pilot cutter took x - 4 days.

**Step 6: Possible Days Assignment**
From the days given (270, 274, 278, 282), and using the deductions:
- If Ed Alexander took 278 days (middle value to allow +4 and -4 days), then Tara Carroll took 282 days, and the sailor in the pilot cutter took 274 days.

**Step 7: Assigning Days Based on Clue 2**
Since Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop had to finish in either 270 or 278 days:
- If Ed Alexander is not in the sloop (as he took 278 days), then Vicky Estes cannot be in 278 days. Thus, Vicky Estes must be the one who finished in 270 days, and the sloop competitor finished in 278 days.

**Step 8: Assigning Boat Types**
- Since the pilot cutter finished in 274 days, and Ed Alexander took 278 days, Ed Alexander cannot be in the pilot cutter.
- Wendell Orr must be in the gaff cutter (from Clue 1), and since he is not the one who finished in 270 days (Vicky Estes did), he must be the one who finished in 282 days.

**Step 9: Remaining Assignments**
- Tara Carroll, who took 282 days, cannot be Wendell Orr or Vicky Estes, and she is not Ed Alexander. Thus, she must be in the remaining boat type, which is the schooner.
- The remaining sailor for 278 days and the sloop is Ed Alexander.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- ""Night Ninjas"" was ranked 1 place ahead of the ""Oil Crew"".
- This means if Night Ninjas are in position n, Oil Crew must be in position n+1.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- ""Target Bombs"" was ranked 1 place behind the orange team.
- If the orange team is in position m, Target Bombs must be in position m+1.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Of the ""Oil Crew"" and the group that finished third, one uses orange paintballs and the other uses red paintballs.
- Since Oil Crew is either directly before or after the orange team (from Clue 4), Oil Crew must be either orange or red.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- ""Splat Squad"", the purple team, and the team that finished third are all different teams.
- This means Splat Squad cannot be third or purple.

Step 5: Deduce from Clues 1, 2, 3, and 4
- If Night Ninjas are first, Oil Crew must be second (from Clue 1).
- If Oil Crew is second and uses either orange or red (from Clue 3), and since the orange team is directly followed by Target Bombs (from Clue 4), Oil Crew cannot be orange (as Target Bombs would then be third, conflicting with Clue 2 where the third team is not Splat Squad or purple).
- Therefore, Oil Crew must be red and second. The orange team must be third, and Target Bombs fourth.

Step 6: Assign remaining colors and positions
- Since Splat Squad cannot be third or purple (from Clue 2), and third is orange, Splat Squad must be first or fourth. Since purple is not third and Splat Squad is not purple, purple must be fourth.
- Therefore, Splat Squad is first and yellow (as all other colors are assigned).

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
- The beverage that cost $3.60 and the iced americano are ordered by Henry and Charlie. This means one of these two customers ordered the $3.60 drink and the other ordered the iced americano.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- Darrell's coffee cost 20 cents less than Charlie's. Since we know from Step 1 that Charlie either ordered the $3.60 drink or the iced americano, we can start to consider the prices around these options.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Jacob's drink cost 20 cents less than the espresso. This clue will help us once we identify the price of the espresso.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The vanilla latte cost more than Darrell's beverage. This helps us place the vanilla latte in a higher price bracket relative to Darrell's order.

Step 5: Deductions from Clues 1 and 2
- If Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink, Darrell's drink would be $3.40 (20 cents less). If Charlie ordered the iced americano, we need to find the price of the iced americano to determine Darrell's drink price.

Step 6: Further Deductions
- Since the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink and Darrell's drink could be $3.40 or less, the vanilla latte cannot be the lowest price. It must be higher than $3.40.

Step 7: Assigning Prices
- If we assign the $3.60 price to Charlie and he didn't order the iced americano, then he must have ordered something else, possibly the espresso or vanilla latte. Since the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink, and Darrell's drink is 20 cents less than Charlie's, Darrell cannot have the highest price. Thus, Charlie did not order the iced americano; he ordered the $3.60 drink. Henry then ordered the iced americano.

Step 8: Price of Espresso and Jacob's Order
- Since Jacob's drink is 20 cents less than the espresso, and we know the prices left are $3.30 and $3.50, the espresso must be $3.50, making Jacob's drink $3.30.

Step 9: Finalizing Orders
- Darrell's drink is 20 cents less than Charlie's. Since Charlie's drink is $3.60, Darrell's must be $3.40. The only option left for the vanilla latte, which is more than $3.40, is $3.50. Therefore, espresso is $3.50, and since Jacob's drink is 20 cents less, he must have ordered the macchiato at $3.30.

Final Answer:
$3.30 | Jacob | macchiato
$3.40 | Darrell | vanilla latte

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 2**
- Clue 1 states that Amerigo made $6 million less than the movie directed by Hick Harmon.
- Clue 2 states that Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo.

From these clues, we can establish a relationship between the earnings of Amerigo, Zephyr Breeze, and the movie directed by Hick Harmon. However, we need more information to assign specific values.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that of the movie directed by Nan Norman and Easy to Love, one made $11 million and the other made $2 million.

This clue gives us specific earnings for two movies, but we don't yet know which movie corresponds to which earning.

**Step 3: Deduce from Clue 4 and Clue 1**
- If Amerigo made $2 million (the lowest possible from the given earnings), then the movie directed by Hick Harmon would have made $8 million (since Amerigo made $6 million less than Hick Harmon's movie). 
- However, if Amerigo made $5 million, then Hick Harmon's movie would have made $11 million. This fits within the available earnings and aligns with Clue 2, where Zephyr Breeze would then make $11 million ($6 million more than Amerigo's $5 million).

**Step 4: Confirming with Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the movie directed by Micah Moreno made somewhat more than Tippecanoe.
- If Amerigo made $5 million and Zephyr Breeze made $11 million, then the remaining earnings for Micah Moreno's movie and Tippecanoe are $2 million and $8 million.
- Since Micah Moreno's movie made more than Tippecanoe, Micah Moreno's movie must be the one with $8 million, and Tippecanoe made $2 million.

**Step 5: Assigning directors to movies**
- From Step 3, Hick Harmon's movie made $11 million, which must be Zephyr Breeze.
- From Step 4, Micah Moreno's movie made $8 million, which is not yet assigned, so it must be Easy to Love.
- From Clue 4, Nan Norman's movie is either $11 million or $2 million. Since $11 million is taken by Zephyr Breeze (Hick Harmon), Nan Norman directed the movie that made $2 million, which is Tippecanoe.
- Amerigo, therefore, made $5 million and was directed by the remaining director, Odette Olson.

### Final Answer:
$2 million | Tippecanoe | Nan Norman

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that of the film that grossed $5 million and the film that grossed $8 million, one is Fast and Dead and the other was directed by Linda Lynch. This means Fast and Dead and Linda Lynch's movie are either $5 million or $8 million.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that Amerigo made $3 million less than Fast and Dead. Since Fast and Dead is either $5 million or $8 million, Amerigo must be either $2 million or $5 million.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that Amerigo is either the film that grossed $2 million or the film directed by Nan Norman. Combining this with Step 2, Amerigo must be the $2 million movie, as it cannot be $5 million (since Fast and Dead is either $5 million or $8 million).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that of the film directed by Hick Harmon and the film that grossed $8 million, one is Easy to Love and the other is Fast and Dead. Since we know Fast and Dead is either $5 million or $8 million, and Amerigo is $2 million, Fast and Dead must be $8 million. Therefore, Easy to Love is directed by Hick Harmon.

**Step 5: Assign remaining values**
- Since Fast and Dead is $8 million, and Amerigo is $2 million, the remaining movies are What a World and Easy to Love. Since Easy to Love is directed by Hick Harmon, What a World must be directed by Linda Lynch (from Clue 1, Linda Lynch directed either the $5 million or $8 million movie).
- The remaining earnings are $5 million and $11 million. Since Fast and Dead is $8 million, and Amerigo is $2 million, What a World must be $5 million (as it's directed by Linda Lynch from Clue 1).

Since we know Fast and Dead is either $5 million or $8 million, and Amerigo is $2 million, Fast and Dead must be $8 million. Therefore, Easy to Love is directed by Hick Harmon.

**Step 5: Assign remaining values**
- Since Fast and Dead is $8 million, and Amerigo is $2 million, the remaining movies are What a World and Easy to Love. Since Easy to Love is directed by Hick Harmon, What a World must be directed by Linda Lynch (from Clue 1, Linda Lynch directed either the $5 million or $8 million movie).
- The remaining earnings are $5 million and $11 million. Since Fast and Dead is $8 million, and Amerigo is $2 million, What a World must be $5 million (as it's directed by Linda Lynch from Clue 1).
- The only remaining director for Fast and Dead is Nan Norman, and the only remaining movie for $11 million is Easy to Love.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 5
- It states that the hybrid sling and the Russets scored either 180 ft or 135 ft. This means the other distances (150 ft and 165 ft) are not possible for these two.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- The team that made it to 135 ft was either the Flying Eyes or the contestants that used the hybrid sling. Since the hybrid sling is linked to either 135 ft or 180 ft from Clue 5, it's possible that the hybrid sling could be the device used for 135 ft.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The trebuchet was used by either the team that made it to 150 ft or the Flying Eyes. Since we don't have enough information yet to decide, we keep this in mind for later.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The catapult landed 30 feet short of the slingshot. This means the distances for the catapult and slingshot must be consecutive in the list of distances (135 ft, 150 ft, 165 ft, 180 ft).

Step 5: Analyze Clue 4
- The Spud Chuckers landed somewhat short of the Yukon Bolds. This means the Spud Chuckers did not achieve the longest distance, and the Yukon Bolds did not achieve the shortest.

Step 6: Deduce from Clues 2, 4, and 5
- If the hybrid sling is at 135 ft, then from Clue 5, the Russets must be at 180 ft. This fits as it leaves 150 ft and 165 ft for the remaining teams and devices.
- From Clue 2, if the catapult is 30 ft shorter than the slingshot, and considering the remaining distances, the catapult must be at 135 ft and the slingshot at 165 ft. This fits with the hybrid sling being at 135 ft.

Step 7: Place the Teams
- Since the Russets are at 180 ft and the hybrid sling is at 135 ft, the Flying Eyes must be at 150 ft using the trebuchet (from Clue 1).
- This leaves the Spud Chuckers at 165 ft with the slingshot, and the Yukon Bolds at 180 ft with the catapult.

Final Answer:
135 ft | Flying Eyes | hybrid sling

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person with 84 LinkedIn connections is either the person with 150 Facebook friends or Vickie.
- This implies two possibilities: 
  - Vickie has 84 LinkedIn connections, or
  - The person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the one with 150 Facebook friends and the one with 130 Facebook friends, one is Yvonne and the other has 84 LinkedIn connections.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we can deduce:
  - If the person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections, then Yvonne must have 130 Facebook friends.
  - If Vickie has 84 LinkedIn connections, she cannot have 150 Facebook friends, so she must have a different number of Facebook friends.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari.
- This means Danny and Kari must be assigned to Facebook friend counts that are 20 apart (e.g., 120 and 140, or 130 and 150).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections.
- This sets a specific relationship between the Facebook friends of those with 57 and 70 LinkedIn connections.

**Step 5: Deductions and Assignments**
- Since Yvonne and the person with 84 LinkedIn connections are tied to 150 and 130 Facebook friends, and Danny and Kari have a 20 difference, Danny and Kari cannot be 150 or 130. They must be 120 and 140 or vice versa.
- If Danny has more Facebook friends than Kari, and they are 20 apart, Danny must be 140 and Kari 120.
- This leaves 150 for Yvonne and 130 for Vickie.
- Assign LinkedIn connections based on remaining clues and previous deductions:
  - Yvonne (150 Facebook) cannot have 84 LinkedIn (as Vickie or the person with 150 Facebook has 84, and Vickie is not Yvonne), so Vickie must have 84 LinkedIn and 130 Facebook.
  - Danny (140 Facebook) and Kari (120 Facebook) must fit the remaining LinkedIn connections of 57 and 70. Since the one with 57 LinkedIn has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn, Danny must have 57 LinkedIn and Kari 70 LinkedIn.

  - August 22nd | Zathdrill | graphic design
  - August 23rd | Haytouch | social media

This arrangement satisfies all the clues and the constraints of the puzzle.","1. **Analyzing Clue 1**: The Haytouch interview is 2 days before the interview for the graphic design position.
   - This means there must be a 1-day gap between Haytouch and graphic design interviews.

2. **Analyzing Clue 4**: The Zathdrill interview is 2 days after the Haytouch interview.
   - This sets a fixed sequence: Haytouch, then 2 days later, Zathdrill.

3. **Combining Clues 1 and 4**: Since Haytouch and Zathdrill are separated by 2 days, and Haytouch is 2 days before the graphic design interview, the only possible arrangement that fits all days of the week is:
   - Haytouch on August 20th, Zathdrill on August 22nd, and graphic design on August 23rd.

4. **Analyzing Clue 2**: Of the interview for the social media position and the Laneplex interview, one is on August 23rd and the other is on August 20th.
   - Since August 20th is already taken by Haytouch, Laneplex must be on August 20th, and the social media position must be on August 23rd.

5. **Analyzing Clue 3**: The meeting for the janitor position is sometime after the Streeter Inc. interview.
   - Since August 20th and 23rd are occupied by Laneplex and social media respectively, and August 22nd is taken by Zathdrill, Streeter Inc. must be on August 21st. Consequently, the janitor position must be on August 22nd.

6. **Filling Remaining Slots**: 
   - August 21st is left with the tech support position since all other positions are accounted for.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- The 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Ece Suss is either the 1992 bottle or the 1996 wine.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Zifennwein was bottled 4 years after the pinot gris. This means the Zifennwein cannot be the 1996 wine (as it would require the pinot gris to be 1992, conflicting with Clue 3 where Ece Suss could be 1992). Therefore, the 1996 wine must be the syrah, and Zifennwein is not 1996.

**Step 4: From Step 3**
- Since the 1996 wine is syrah, and Zifennwein is not 1996, by Clue 2, Zifennwein must be a different year.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the pinot gris and the 1984 wine, one is the Annata Branco and the other is the Friambliss. 

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 1**
- The Friambliss was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir. Since Friambliss is either 1984 or pinot gris from Clue 4, and it precedes pinot noir by 4 years, pinot noir cannot be 1988 (as it would imply Friambliss is 1984, leaving no room for pinot gris in 1984). Thus, Friambliss must be pinot gris, and Annata Branco is 1984.

**Step 7: From Step 6**
- Since Friambliss is pinot gris, and it precedes pinot noir by 4 years, pinot noir must be 1992 (as 1988 + 4 = 1992).

**Step 8: From Step 3 and Step 7**
- Since Ece Suss is either 1992 or 1996, and 1992 is pinot noir, Ece Suss must be 1996.

**Step 9: From Step 5 and Step 8**
- Since Annata Branco is 1984, and Friambliss is pinot gris, Friambliss must be 1988.

**Step 10: From Step 4 and Step 9**
- Since Zifennwein is not 1996 and must be 4 years after pinot gris (1988), Zifennwein must be 1992.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**
- Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau.

From Steps 1 and 2, we can infer that:
- If Alpha Beta Tau has \( x \) members, then Beta Pi Omega has \( x + 3 \) members, and the fraternity on Boom Court has \( x - 3 \) members.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or the frat on Aspen Court.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road, one has 23 members and the other has 29 members.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clues 1, 2, 3, and 4**
- Since Tau Beta Pi could be the house with 23 members or on Aspen Court, and considering the member counts from Clues 1 and 3, we can start assigning possible member counts to fraternities:
  - If Alpha Beta Tau has 26 members (a middle value that allows for both increases and decreases as per Clues 1 and 3), then:
    - Beta Pi Omega would have 29 members.
    - The fraternity on Boom Court would have 23 members.
  - This setup allows Tau Beta Pi to be either 23 members or on Aspen Court.

**Step 6: Assigning Streets**
- Since the fraternity on Boom Court has 23 members, and Tau Beta Pi could be 23 members, Tau Beta Pi fits on Boom Court if it's not on Aspen Court.
- Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road are either 23 or 29 members. Since 29 members are taken by Beta Pi Omega, Sigma Beta must be 23 members and on Russell Road.

**Step 7: Remaining Assignments**
- The only remaining street for Alpha Beta Tau is Norwood Street.
- The only remaining fraternity for 32 members is the one not yet assigned, which must be on Aspen Court.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
- ""The temple in Nakai was built 60 years after Yamasaki.""
- This implies that Yamasaki must be built 60 years before the temple in Nakai.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- ""Matsuno Okura was built 60 years after the shrine in Nakai.""
- Since the temple in Nakai is 60 years after Yamasaki, and Matsuno Okura is 60 years after Nakai, Matsuno Okura is 120 years after Yamasaki.

Step 3: Determine possible years for Yamasaki
- Since Yamasaki is followed by Nakai (60 years later) and then Matsuno Okura (another 60 years later), Yamasaki cannot be later than 1645 because there must be 120 years available after it for the other two shrines.
- If Yamasaki is in 1525, then Nakai is in 1585, and Matsuno Okura is in 1705.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- ""Of Takahashi and the temple in Uchida, one was built in 1525 and the other was built in 1705.""
- Since Matsuno Okura is in 1705, Takahashi cannot be in 1705. Therefore, Takahashi must be in 1525 and the temple in Uchida must be in 1705.

Step 5: Assign remaining shrine and town
- The remaining year is 1645, which must be assigned to Amari Michi.
- The remaining town is Usui.

Step 6: Review Clue 1
- ""The structure in Niwa is either Amari Michi or Yamasaki.""
- Since Yamasaki is already assigned to 1525 and not in Niwa, Amari Michi must be in Niwa.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that between Officer Yates and the dog graduating in May, one is paired with Jaws and the other with Hercules. This doesn't specify the exact month or officer for each dog yet, but it sets a relationship.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that Aries graduated sometime after Jaws. This means Jaws cannot be in June, and Aries cannot be in March.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman. This means if Nolan's dog graduated in March, Zimmerman's must be in May; if Nolan's is in April, Zimmerman's is in June.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that the dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell. This means Fox's dog cannot be in June, and Tinkerbell cannot be in March.

**Step 5: Deductions from Clues**
- From Clue 3 and Clue 4, if Zimmerman's dog is in May or June, and Tinkerbell is not in March, Tinkerbell could be Zimmerman's dog in May or June. If Zimmerman is in May, then Nolan must be in March. This fits as Fox cannot be in June (Clue 4), and Tinkerbell cannot be in March.

**Step 6: Placement of Jaws and Hercules**
- From Clue 1, if Yates is paired with one of Jaws or Hercules and the other is in May, and considering the placement from Step 5, if Zimmerman is in May with Tinkerbell, then Yates cannot be in May. Thus, Yates must be with Jaws or Hercules in another month. Since Jaws must be before Aries (Clue 2) and Aries cannot be in March, Jaws cannot be in June. If Jaws is in March, then Hercules must be in May.

**Step 7: Assign Remaining Slots**
- Jaws is in March with Yates (from Step 6 and Clue 1). Hercules is in May (from Step 6). Aries is after Jaws and cannot be in March or May, so Aries must be in June. The remaining dog, Tinkerbell, must be in April.
- Nolan's dog is 2 months before Zimmerman's. If Zimmerman is in May with Tinkerbell, Nolan must be in March. The remaining officer for June is Fox.

**Final Answer:**
- Fill the table based on deductions:

| Month  | Dog         | Officer    |

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The symposium event will involve 25 more people than Clarence's assignment.
- This means Clarence's event cannot have 125 people, as no option allows for 150 attendees.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- Of the symposium job and the graduation assignment, one will be handled by Mabel and the other will have 125 attendees.
- Since symposium has 25 more people than Clarence's event, symposium cannot have 125 attendees. Therefore, the graduation must have 125 attendees.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The retreat job will involve somewhat fewer people than the graduation job.
- Since graduation has 125 attendees, retreat must have fewer than 125 attendees.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- The snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The yellow balloon cost 2 dollars less than the red balloon.
  - This means the price difference between the yellow and red balloon is $2.00.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The dog cost 1 dollar more than the yellow piece.
  - Since the yellow balloon is $2.00 less than the red balloon, and the prices are $3.00, $4.00, $5.00, $6.00, the yellow balloon cannot be $6.00 or $3.00 (as $3.00 + $1.00 = $4.00, which is possible, but $6.00 + $1.00 = $7.00, which is not a listed price). Thus, yellow must be $3.00 or $4.00.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red.
  - Since we know the red balloon is $2.00 more than the yellow balloon, if yellow is $3.00, red must be $5.00. If yellow is $4.00, red must be $6.00.

**Step 5: Combine Clues 3 and 5**
- If yellow is $3.00, then red is $5.00. The dog, costing $1.00 more than the yellow balloon, would be $4.00.
- If yellow is $4.00, then red is $6.00. The dog, costing $1.00 more than the yellow balloon, would be $5.00. But this conflicts with the red balloon's price, so yellow must be $3.00, red is $5.00, and the dog is $4.00.

**Step 6: Revisit Clue 4**
- Since the snail is either $6.00 or $3.00, and yellow is $3.00, the snail cannot be yellow. Thus, the snail must be $6.00.

**Step 7: Revisit Clue 1**
- The monkey cost more than the gold animal.
  - Since the snail is $6.00, it cannot be gold (as no price is higher than $6.00). The remaining prices for the monkey are $5.00 (already taken by red) or $4.00 (taken by the dog). Thus, the monkey must be $3.00, and it cannot be gold either.

**Step 8: Finalize Colors and Animals**
- The remaining animal for $5.00 (red) is the cat.
- The remaining color for $3.00 (yellow) is the monkey.
- The remaining color for $6.00 (snail) must be either orange or gold. Since the cat is red and the dog is yellow, the snail must be orange (as per Clue 2, the cat or $6.00 balloon is orange/red).
- The remaining color for $4.00 (dog) is gold.

$4.00 | dog | gold
$5.00 | cat | red
$6.00 | monkey | orange","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- The snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The yellow balloon cost 2 dollars less than the red balloon.
  - This means the price difference between the yellow and red balloon is $2.00.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The dog cost 1 dollar more than the yellow piece.
  - Since the yellow balloon is $2.00 less than the red balloon, and the prices are $3.00, $4.00, $5.00, $6.00, the yellow balloon cannot be $6.00 or $3.00 (as $3.00 + $1.00 = $4.00, which is possible, but $6.00 + $1.00 = $7.00, which is not a listed price). Thus, yellow must be $3.00 or $4.00.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red.
  - Since we know the red balloon is $2.00 more than the yellow balloon, if yellow is $3.00, red must be $5.00. If yellow is $4.00, red must be $6.00.

**Step 5: Combine Clues 3 and 5**
- If yellow is $3.00, then red is $5.00. The dog, costing $1.00 more than the yellow balloon, would be $4.00.
- If yellow is $4.00, then red is $6.00. The dog, costing $1.00 more than the yellow balloon, would be $5.00. But this conflicts with the red balloon's price, so yellow must be $3.00, red is $5.00, and the dog is $4.00.

**Step 6: Revisit Clue 4**
- Since the snail is either $6.00 or $3.00, and yellow is $3.00, the snail cannot be yellow. Thus, the snail must be $6.00.

**Step 7: Revisit Clue 1**
- The monkey cost more than the gold animal.
  - Since the snail is $6.00, it cannot be gold (as no price is higher than $6.00). The remaining prices for the monkey are $5.00 (already taken by red) or $4.00 (taken by the dog). Thus, the monkey must be $3.00, and it cannot be gold either.

**Step 8: Finalize Colors and Animals**
- The remaining animal for $5.00 (red) is the cat.
- The remaining color for $3.00 (yellow) is the monkey.
- The remaining color for $6.00 (snail) must be either orange or gold. Since the cat is red and the dog is yellow, the snail must be orange (as per Clue 2, the cat or $6.00 balloon is orange/red).
- The remaining color for $4.00 (dog) is gold.

   - Since the ages available are 14, 32, 50, and 68, and the difference must be 36 years, the only possible ages for the horned tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise are 14 and 50, or 32 and 68. Since Methuselah is 32 and not a species, the horned tortoise must be 14 and the two rimmed tortoise 50.
   - 14 | ? | horned
   - 50 | ? | two rimmed

3. Apply Clue 3
   - Chewie is either the pitch belly tortoise or the 50-year-old one.
   - Since the 50-year-old tortoise is the two rimmed tortoise, Chewie cannot be 50 years old. Therefore, Chewie must be the pitch belly tortoise.
   - ? | Chewie | pitch belly

4. Apply Clue 4
   - Of the black neck tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise, one is 68 years old and the other is named Shelly.
   - Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, the black neck tortoise must be 68 years old. Shelly must be the name of the two rimmed tortoise.
   - 68 | ? | black neck
   - 50 | Shelly | two rimmed

5. Assign Remaining Options
   - Methuselah is 32 and not associated with a species yet.
   - Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise, but we don't know the age.
   - Yoda is the remaining tortoise to be placed.

6. From the remaining options:
   - Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise, and the only ages left for Chewie are 14 or 68. Since 68 is taken by the black neck tortoise, Chewie must be 14.
   - 14 | Chewie | pitch belly
   - This leaves Yoda to be 68 years old.
   - 68 | Yoda | black neck
