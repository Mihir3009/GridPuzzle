"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 6**
- The 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- The 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 5**
- The Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.
- The Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.

From these clues, we can deduce that Ece Suss must be bottled before Bianca Flaux, and Bianca Flaux must be bottled before Vendemmia. Since Bianca Flaux is 4 years before Vendemmia, they cannot be consecutive years. Thus, if Ece Suss is 1984, Bianca Flaux can't be 1988 (as it's pinot noir), so Ece Suss can't be 1984. If Ece Suss is 1992, Bianca Flaux would be 1996, and Vendemmia would be out of range. Therefore, Ece Suss must be 1984 or 1992.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- The Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.

This means Annata Branco must be before Ece Suss. If Ece Suss is 1992, Annata Branco could be 1988 or 1984. But 1988 is pinot noir, so Annata Branco must be 1984.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.

Since Annata Branco is 1984 and gewurztraminer, Bianca Flaux must be the merlot.

**Step 6: Finalize the years**
- Annata Branco is 1984 and gewurztraminer.
- Ece Suss is 1992 (after Annata Branco).
- Bianca Flaux is 1996 (4 years after Vendemmia, which must be 1992).
- Vendemmia is 1992 and must be the remaining type, riesling.

**Step 7: Assign remaining types**
- Since 1988 is pinot noir, it must be the remaining wine, which is not yet assigned, so it's Ece Suss.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3**
- Clue 1 states that the rose that won fourth place was Hannah's.
- Clue 3 states that the altissimo won fourth place.
- From these clues, we can conclude that Hannah's rose is altissimo and it won fourth place.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that the flower that won second place, the calocarpa, and the bon silene were all different flowers.
- Since altissimo is already in fourth place, it implies that neither calocarpa nor bon silene can be in fourth place.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5**
- Clue 4 states that the bon silene finished 1 place ahead of Tricia's rose.
- Clue 5 states that the bon silene finished 2 places ahead of Nellie's flower.
- Since bon silene cannot be fourth or third (from Clue 2 and its implications), it must be either first or second. If bon silene were second, Tricia's rose would be third and Nellie's would be fourth, but fourth is taken by altissimo. Therefore, bon silene must be first, Tricia's rose second, and Nellie's rose third.

**Step 4: Deduce Remaining Placements**
- With bon silene first, Tricia's rose second, and Nellie's rose third, the only remaining rose for second place that isn't calocarpa (from Clue 2) is perle d'or.
- Therefore, calocarpa must be third.

**Step 5: Identify Remaining Gardener for Third Place**
- Since Hannah is fourth and Tricia is second, Renee must be the gardener for the third place.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Start with definite clues**:
   - Clue 2 states that Galen scored 62%.
   - Clue 4 states that Proclus scored 76%.

2. **Use the information about scores**:
   - Since Proclus scored 76%, by Clue 3, Proclus is not from Oxford (as it was either Galen or the system from Oxford). Therefore, Galen is from Oxford.

3. **Analyze the remaining scores and AI**:
   - We have scores left: 55% and 69%.
   - We have AI systems left: Archimedes and Zeno.
   - We have institutions left: CIT, Exeter, UCLA.

4. **Use Clue 1 and Clue 5**:
   - Clue 1: Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA.
   - Clue 5: The system that scored 55% was either the system from CIT or Zeno.

   Since Zeno cannot score both 55% and a score 7% higher than another, Zeno must score 69% (55% + 7% = 62%, but Galen already has 62%). Therefore, UCLA must have 62%, but since Galen has 62% and is from Oxford, UCLA must have another score. Thus, Zeno cannot be from UCLA and must be from another institution.

5. **Assign the remaining scores and institutions**:
   - Since Zeno scored 69%, the remaining score of 55% must be assigned to Archimedes.
   - Since the system from CIT was either 55% or Zeno, and Zeno is 69%, Archimedes must be from CIT.
   - The remaining institution for Zeno is Exeter (as UCLA and Oxford are taken by Galen and Proclus respectively).

"**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Start with Clue 2**: Tracy's letter was sent in 1962. This gives us a direct placement in the grid.

2. **Use Clue 5**: Sean's bottle was from Le Havre. This identifies the origin of Sean's message.

3. **Analyze Clue 4**: Sean's missive is either the letter that was sent in 1983 or the message that was sent in 1962. Since Tracy's letter was sent in 1962, Sean's letter must be the one sent in 1983.

4. **Apply Clue 3**: The bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive. Since Tracy's letter was sent in 1962, and we don't yet know the origin, we can tentatively link Tracy to Plymouth, but we need to confirm this with other clues.

5. **Use Clue 1**: The message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg. This helps us calculate the years for Plymouth and Cherbourg. If Plymouth is linked to Tracy (1962), then Cherbourg's letter must be from 1948, which is not possible as it's not in the given years. Therefore, Plymouth must be linked to a different year. Since Sean's letter is from 1983 and from Le Havre, Plymouth must be linked to 1976 (1983 - 14 years = 1969, but since 1969 is not linked to Plymouth, the next possible year for Plymouth is 1976).

6. **Determine Remaining Assignments**: With Tracy in 1962 and Sean in 1983, Karla or Felipe must be linked to the remaining years. Since Plymouth is 1976 and must be either Karla's or Tracy's, and Tracy is already linked to 1962, Karla must be linked to Plymouth in 1976. The remaining writer, Felipe, must be linked to the remaining year, 1969, and the remaining origin, Cherbourg.

4. **Apply Clue 1:** The outing to Eastbrook logged 7 fewer shooting stars than the trip to Isleton. Since 16 and 9 are already used, and 23 - 7 = 16 (already used), the only possibility is 2 for Eastbrook and 9 for Isleton.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Start with Known Information**: From clue 1, Underwood is in room 114.

2. **Use Clue 2**: The guest in room 320 is staying 1 day fewer than Underwood. Since we don't know Underwood's stay yet, we'll need to revisit this after determining Underwood's stay.

3. **Use Clue 3**: Owens is staying for 3 days.

4. **Use Clue 4**: Parker is staying 1 day longer than the client in room 314. We need to determine who is in room 314 and their stay duration.

5. **Determine Underwood's Stay**: Since Underwood is in room 114 and the guest in room 320 stays 1 day fewer, Underwood must stay more than 2 days (as 1 day stay is not an option). If Underwood stays for 4 days, the guest in room 320 stays for 3 days. If Underwood stays for 5 days, the guest in room 320 stays for 4 days. Since Owens is already staying for 3 days, Underwood must stay for 5 days, and the guest in room 320 stays for 4 days.

6. **Assign Rooms and Days**: Underwood in room 114 for 5 days. Owens stays for 3 days but room unknown. The guest in room 320 stays for 4 days.

7. **Assign Parker and Room 314**: Since Parker stays 1 day longer than the guest in room 314, and the only remaining options for days are 2 and 4, the guest in room 314 must stay for 2 days, making Parker stay for 3 days. Since Owens is already staying for 3 days, Parker must be in a different room. Thus, Parker is in room 124 (the only remaining option for 3 days).

8. **Assign Remaining Guest and Room**: Zamora is the only remaining guest and must be in room 320 for 4 days. Owens must be in the remaining room, which is 314.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Start with given facts:**
   - Stuart lost 7 lbs (Clue 3).
   - Wesley lost 5 lbs (Clue 5).

2. **Use Clue 1:**
   - Stuart lost 4 more pounds than the person on the vegan diet. Since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet lost 3 lbs.

3. **Assign weights to names:**
   - Stuart = 7 lbs
   - Wesley = 5 lbs
   - Vegan diet = 3 lbs

4. **Use Clue 2:**
   - The person on the gluten-free diet lost 2 more pounds than Raymond. Since we have 3 lbs and 5 lbs assigned, and 7 lbs is taken by Stuart, Raymond must have lost either 3 lbs or 5 lbs. Since 3 lbs is assigned to the vegan diet, Raymond must have lost 5 lbs, and the gluten-free diet must be 7 lbs.

5. **Use Clue 4:**
   - The dieter who lost 7 lbs is either the person who used the caveman diet or Raymond. Since Raymond lost 5 lbs, the caveman diet must be the one with 7 lbs, which is assigned to Stuart.

6. **Assign remaining diet:**
   - Since Stuart is on the caveman diet and lost 7 lbs, and the gluten-free diet is 7 lbs (assigned to Raymond), the remaining diet (dairy-free) must be assigned to Wesley who lost 5 lbs.

7. **Assign remaining pounds:**

2. **Use Clue 1:**
   - Stuart lost 4 more pounds than the person on the vegan diet. Since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet lost 3 lbs.

3. **Assign weights to names:**
   - Stuart = 7 lbs
   - Wesley = 5 lbs
   - Vegan diet = 3 lbs

4. **Use Clue 2:**
   - The person on the gluten-free diet lost 2 more pounds than Raymond. Since we have 3 lbs and 5 lbs assigned, and 7 lbs is taken by Stuart, Raymond must have lost either 3 lbs or 5 lbs. Since 3 lbs is assigned to the vegan diet, Raymond must have lost 5 lbs, and the gluten-free diet must be 7 lbs.

5. **Use Clue 4:**
   - The dieter who lost 7 lbs is either the person who used the caveman diet or Raymond. Since Raymond lost 5 lbs, the caveman diet must be the one with 7 lbs, which is assigned to Stuart.

6. **Assign remaining diet:**
   - Since Stuart is on the caveman diet and lost 7 lbs, and the gluten-free diet is 7 lbs (assigned to Raymond), the remaining diet (dairy-free) must be assigned to Wesley who lost 5 lbs.

7. **Assign remaining pounds:**
   - The only remaining unassigned weight is 9 lbs, which must be assigned to Tom.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

| Pounds Lost | Name    | Diet        |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 3           | Tom     | Vegan       |

"**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Analyze Clue 1:** Yvette's purchase was either the insect that sold for $45 or the peacock butterfly. This clue gives two possibilities for Yvette's purchase.

2. **Analyze Clue 2:** The swallowtail butterfly cost $15 more than Phillip's purchase. This clue links the price of Phillip's purchase to the price of the swallowtail butterfly.

3. **Analyze Clue 3:** The atlas butterfly cost more than the peacock butterfly. This clue establishes a price hierarchy between the atlas and peacock butterflies.

4. **Analyze Clue 4:** The four butterflies were the butterfly that sold for $90, the grayling butterfly, Yvette's purchase, and Walter's purchase. This clue helps identify the specific butterflies and their associated prices or owners.

**Logical deductions:**
- Since the swallowtail costs $15 more than Phillip's purchase, and there are only four price points ($45, $60, $75, $90), Phillip cannot have bought the $90 butterfly. Thus, Phillip's purchase could be $45, $60, or $75.
- If Phillip bought the $45 butterfly, the swallowtail would be $60. If Phillip bought the $60 butterfly, the swallowtail would be $75. If Phillip bought the $75 butterfly, the swallowtail would be $90.
- Since the atlas costs more than the peacock, and the peacock is possibly Yvette's purchase, the peacock cannot be the most expensive butterfly. Thus, the atlas cannot be the cheapest ($45).

**Further deductions and final arrangement:**
- If Yvette's purchase was the $45 butterfly, it cannot be the peacock (since the atlas must be more expensive than the peacock and cannot be the cheapest). Thus, Yvette's $45 purchase must be a different butterfly, leaving the peacock to be more expensive.
- Since the swallowtail is $15 more than Phillip's purchase, and considering the prices, if Phillip's purchase is $75, the swallowtail would be $90, which fits as it is one of the four mentioned in Clue 4.

**Final Answer:**
- Continue with similar deductions to fill the table completely, ensuring each winner and butterfly is used only once and all clues are satisfied.

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**
- Eugene will depart from Farley.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person departing from Farley (Eugene) will leave 2 days before the person departing from Hardwick.
- Since Eugene departs from Farley, we need to find a date for Eugene that allows another departure 2 days later.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- The conductor departing from Epworth will leave 1 day after Mitchell.
- This means Mitchell cannot depart on the last day (June 13), and the person from Epworth cannot depart on the first day (June 10).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- The four conductors are the conductor departing from Farley (Eugene), the conductor working on June 11, Mitchell, and Roderick.
- Since Eugene is already assigned to Farley, we need to assign the other three to the remaining days and places.

**Step 5: Assigning Dates**
- Since Eugene departs from Farley and must leave 2 days before the person from Hardwick, and considering the constraints from Step 3, Eugene can only depart on June 10 or June 11 to allow a departure from Hardwick on June 12 or June 13.
- If Eugene departs on June 10 from Farley, then the person from Hardwick departs on June 12.
- Mitchell cannot depart on June 13 (from Clue 4), so Mitchell must depart on June 11 or June 12.
- If Mitchell departs on June 11, then the person from Epworth (1 day after Mitchell) departs on June 12. This conflicts with the Hardwick departure, so Mitchell must depart on June 12, and the person from Epworth departs on June 13.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 3**: Kurt Koch is the defensive end.
   - This directly places Kurt Koch in the defensive end position.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who played in 5 games last season is the quarterback.
   - This assigns the quarterback position to the player who played 5 games.

3. **Clue 4**: Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker.
   - Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end, we need to find out how many games he played to determine the placekicker's games.

4. **Clue 1**: Edward Ellis played 2 more games than the defensive end.
   - This will help us determine Edward Ellis's games once we know the games played by Kurt Koch (defensive end).

5. **Clue 5**: The running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games last season.
   - This clue will be used to finalize the position once we know more about the games each player played.

Let's assign games:
- Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end and Edward Ellis played 2 more games than him, and the quarterback played 5 games, Kurt Koch cannot have played 5 games. Let's assume Kurt Koch played 3 games (the lowest), then Edward Ellis played 5 games (3 + 2). This makes Edward Ellis the quarterback.

- From Clue 4, if Kurt Koch played 3 games, the placekicker played 5 games. But since Edward Ellis (5 games) is the quarterback, this assumption is incorrect. Let's adjust Kurt Koch to 4 games, then Edward Ellis played 6 games. This makes Edward Ellis the placekicker.

- The quarterback played 5 games, and since Edward Ellis is the placekicker and Kurt Koch is the defensive end, Jack Jensen must be the quarterback.

- The remaining player, Gordon Gregg, must be the running back, and he played in the remaining slot, which is 3 games.

1. **Clue 3**: Kurt Koch is the defensive end.
   - This directly places Kurt Koch in the defensive end position.

2. **Clue 2**: The person who played in 5 games last season is the quarterback.
   - This assigns the quarterback position to the player who played 5 games.

3. **Clue 4**: Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker.
   - Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end, we need to find out how many games he played to determine the placekicker's games.

4. **Clue 1**: Edward Ellis played 2 more games than the defensive end.
   - This will help us determine Edward Ellis's games once we know the games played by Kurt Koch (defensive end).

5. **Clue 5**: The running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games last season.
   - This clue will be used to finalize the position once we know more about the games each player played.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **From Clue 1**: Violet's pet is the boxer.
   - Violet | Boxer

2. **From Clue 3**: Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab.
   - Since we don't know when the black lab was adopted yet, we note that Rosie's pet is adopted one month earlier than the black lab.

3. **From Clue 4**: The four puppies are Rosie's pet, the dog adopted in April, the puppy adopted in February, and the puppy adopted in March.
   - This tells us that all months have a puppy adopted, and Rosie's pet is one of them.

4. **From Clue 2**: Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu.
   - We need to find when the shih tzu was adopted to place Kayla's pet.

5. **Placement of Rosie and Black Lab**:
   - Since Rosie's pet is one month before the black lab and all months have a puppy, if we place the black lab in April (the latest possible month to allow a month before it), Rosie's pet would be in March.
   - Rosie | March

6. **Placement of Shih Tzu and Kayla**:
   - If the shih tzu is placed in January, then Kayla's pet, being 2 months after, would be in March. But March is already taken by Rosie. So, the next possible placement for the shih tzu is February.
   - Shih Tzu | February
   - Kayla | April

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Gracie is 11 years old.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 12 years old.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The 11-year-old condor has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old bird.
- Since Gracie is 11 years old, her wingspan is 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old's wingspan.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The 9-year-old condor is either the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches or Angel.
- From Clue 5, the 114-inch wingspan bird is 12 years old, so the 9-year-old cannot have a 114-inch wingspan.
- Therefore, the 9-year-old must be Angel.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clues 3 and 4**
- Since the 9-year-old is Angel and cannot have a 114-inch wingspan, Angel must have a different wingspan.
- Since Gracie is 11 and has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than Angel, we need to find the possible wingspan for Angel that fits the remaining options (102, 106, 110 inches).

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 2**
- The four condors are the 9-year-old condor, the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches, Buddy, and the condor with a wingspan of 110 inches.
- Since Angel is 9 years old, Angel's wingspan must be one of the remaining options not assigned to the 12-year-old (114 inches) or Gracie (4 inches shorter than Angel).

**Step 7: Deduce Remaining Wingspans**
- If Angel (9 years old) has a wingspan of 110 inches, then Gracie (11 years old) must have a wingspan of 106 inches (4 inches shorter).
- The remaining wingspan of 102 inches must belong to Buddy, and the age must be 8 years old (since 9, 11, and 12 are taken).

**Step 8: Assign Remaining Name and Age**
- Smokey must be the 12-year-old with a 114-inch wingspan.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clues 3 and 4**
- Since the 9-year-old is Angel and cannot have a 114-inch wingspan, Angel must have a different wingspan.

   - January must be the probe going to Mercury because Iunsel (going to Pluto) follows it, and it can't be in February as Disty is in March.
   - February can't be Iunsel (as it's after Mercury and before Uranus), so February is Mercury.
   - Iunsel goes in April (since it's before Uranus and after Mercury), and Moro Jaddo in May (which isn't possible as we only have till April), so Uranus must be in April, and Moro Jaddo in March. This contradicts Clue 2 (Disty is in March). We need to adjust.

6. **Adjustment**:
   - January | Probe to Mercury | Mercury
   - February | Iunsel | Pluto (since it's after Mercury)
   - March | Disty | ?
   - April | Moro Jaddo | Uranus (since it's 1 month after Uranus)

7. **Remaining Destination**:
   - Since Ganymede is the only destination left, Disty must be going to Ganymede.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The four people were the reporter sent out on April 7th, the reporter who covered the solar eclipse, the journalist who covered the earthquake, and Randy Reid.
- This implies Randy Reid is not the reporter for the solar eclipse or the earthquake and did not leave on April 7th.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Randy Reid left 1 day after the journalist who covered the solar eclipse.
- Since Randy Reid is not the reporter for the solar eclipse, this means the solar eclipse reporter left on April 6th, and Randy Reid left on April 7th.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Linda Lott left 1 day before the journalist who covered the flooding.
- Since Randy Reid left on April 7th and is not covering the flooding, the flooding must be covered on a day after Linda Lott leaves. Linda cannot leave on April 7th.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Sid Snyder left 1 day after Tam Terry.
- Since we know the days each reporter can leave based on previous clues, we can start placing reporters on specific days.

**Step 5: Deduction from Clues**
- Since Randy Reid left on April 7th, and he is neither covering the solar eclipse nor the earthquake, he must be covering either the royal wedding or flooding. But from Clue 4, flooding is covered after Linda Lott leaves, and she cannot leave on April 7th. Therefore, Randy Reid covers the royal wedding on April 7th.
- The solar eclipse reporter left on April 6th. Randy Reid is not the solar eclipse reporter, so it must be another reporter.
- Linda Lott must leave before the flooding is reported, and since flooding is not on April 7th, it must be on April 6th. Therefore, Linda Lott leaves on April 5th.
- Since Sid Snyder leaves a day after Tam Terry, and April 5th and 7th are taken, Tam Terry must leave on April 4th, and Sid Snyder on April 5th.

**Step 6: Final Assignment**
- Tam Terry reports on the earthquake on April 4th.
- Sid Snyder reports on the flooding on April 5th.
- The solar eclipse is reported on April 6th by the remaining reporter, Linda Lott.
- Randy Reid reports on the royal wedding on April 7th.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin. This directly places ""bowling pin"" on October 7.

2. **Clue 4:** Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car. This assigns the ""sports car"" shape to Mrs. Nolan.

3. **Clue 1:** Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car. Since Mrs. Nolan's sports car cake cannot be on October 7 (already taken by the bowling pin), it must be on October 8, placing Mrs. Danielson's delivery on October 7.

4. **Clue 3:** The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake. Since October 7 is the bowling pin delivery, Mrs. Ingram cannot have the bowling pin. Therefore, Mrs. Ingram's cake must be delivered on another date, and the bowling pin is confirmed for October 5.

5. **Clue 2:** The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake. To find Mrs. Ingram's cake, we know it can't be on October 5 or 7. If Mrs. Ingram's cake is on October 8, the turtle would need to be delivered on October 6.

6. **Remaining Assignments:** With Mrs. Danielson on October 7 and Mrs. Nolan on October 8, the only remaining customer for October 6 is Estrada. The only remaining cake shape for October 8 (Mrs. Nolan) is the sports car, and the only remaining cake shape for October 6 is the turtle.

| October 8  | Nolan     | Sports Car    |

This solution follows the clues provided and ensures that each assignment is unique and logically consistent with the puzzle's requirements.","### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 5:** The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin. This directly places ""bowling pin"" on October 7.

2. **Clue 4:** Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car. This assigns the ""sports car"" shape to Mrs. Nolan.

3. **Clue 1:** Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car. Since Mrs. Nolan's sports car cake cannot be on October 7 (already taken by the bowling pin), it must be on October 8, placing Mrs. Danielson's delivery on October 7.

4. **Clue 3:** The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake. Since October 7 is the bowling pin delivery, Mrs. Ingram cannot have the bowling pin. Therefore, Mrs. Ingram's cake must be delivered on another date, and the bowling pin is confirmed for October 5.

5. **Clue 2:** The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake. To find Mrs. Ingram's cake, we know it can't be on October 5 or 7. If Mrs. Ingram's cake is on October 8, the turtle would need to be delivered on October 6.

6. **Remaining Assignments:** With Mrs. Danielson on October 7 and Mrs. Nolan on October 8, the only remaining customer for October 6 is Estrada. The only remaining cake shape for October 8 (Mrs. Nolan) is the sports car, and the only remaining cake shape for October 6 is the turtle.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis:** The siren with a loudness of 105 decibels is either the siren released in 2009 or the Bradley X9.
   - This means Bradley X9 or the 2009 siren could be 105 decibels.

2. **Clue 2 Analysis:** The siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009.
   - This implies the 1999 siren has fewer decibels than the 2009 siren.

3. **Clue 3 Analysis:** The Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm.
   - If Bradley X9 is 105 decibels, then Soundarm is 95 decibels, which is not possible as the lowest is 100 decibels. Therefore, Bradley X9 must be louder than 105 decibels.

4. **Clue 4 Analysis:** The Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide.
   - This sets a sequence: Rip Tide < Soundarm.

5. **Clue 5 Analysis:** The Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998.
   - This helps establish a relative loudness between Rip Tide and the 1998 siren.

### Deductions:
- Since Bradley X9 cannot be 105 decibels (from Clue 3), the 2009 siren must be 105 decibels.
- If 2009 is 105 decibels, 1999 must be less, so it could be 100 decibels.
- If Bradley X9 is not 105, it must be higher. Given it's 10 decibels louder than Soundarm, and Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than Rip Tide, if Rip Tide is 100 decibels, Soundarm is 105, and Bradley X9 is 115 decibels.
- Rip Tide, being 10 decibels quieter than the 1998 siren, places the 1998 siren at 110 decibels.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Using Clue 1 and 2**: Henrietta's airplane went 35 feet and was silver. We can fill this in our table.
   - 35 feet | Henrietta | Silver

2. **Using Clue 3**: Omar's design went farther than the silver airplane (35 feet). The only distance farther than 35 feet is 45 feet. Thus, Omar's airplane went 45 feet.
   - 45 feet | Omar | (color to be determined)

3. **Using Clue 5**: The pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane. Since we don't know the distance of the black plane yet, we keep this in mind.

4. **Using Clue 4**: Ella's design went 10 feet farther than the black plane. This clue will be used once we determine the distance of the black plane.

5. **Determining the black and pink planes**: Since the pink plane goes 10 feet farther than the black plane, and the only remaining distances are 15 feet and 25 feet, the black plane must have gone 15 feet (the only way pink can be 10 feet farther is if it went 25 feet).
   - 15 feet | (student to be determined) | Black
   - 25 feet | (student to be determined) | Pink

6. **Applying Clue 4 and 5**: Since the black plane went 15 feet, Ella's plane (10 feet farther) went 25 feet, and the pink plane also went 25 feet.
   - 25 feet | Ella | Pink

7. **Remaining student and color**: The only student left is Valerie, and the only color left is blue. Valerie's plane must be the one that went 45 feet and is blue.

3. **Using Clue 5**: The pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane. Since we don't know the distance of the black plane yet, we keep this in mind.

4. **Using Clue 4**: Ella's design went 10 feet farther than the black plane. This clue will be used once we determine the distance of the black plane.

5. **Determining the black and pink planes**: Since the pink plane goes 10 feet farther than the black plane, and the only remaining distances are 15 feet and 25 feet, the black plane must have gone 15 feet (the only way pink can be 10 feet farther is if it went 25 feet).
   - 15 feet | (student to be determined) | Black
   - 25 feet | (student to be determined) | Pink

6. **Applying Clue 4 and 5**: Since the black plane went 15 feet, Ella's plane (10 feet farther) went 25 feet, and the pink plane also went 25 feet.
   - 25 feet | Ella | Pink

7. **Remaining student and color**: The only student left is Valerie, and the only color left is blue. Valerie's plane must be the one that went 45 feet and is blue.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis**: The Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people are all different cultures. This means Oiracha is not founded in 850 AD and doesn't have a population of 4,500.

2. **Clue 2 Analysis**: The culture with 9,500 people was founded before the culture with 4,500 people. This sets a temporal order between these two populations.

3. **Clue 3 Analysis**: Of the culture with 4,500 people and the culture with 9,500 people, one was the Budel culture and the other was founded in 600 AD. This clue links Budel and the year 600 AD to either 4,500 or 9,500 people.

4. **Clue 4 Analysis**: The culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people. This helps us find the founding years of the cultures with 5,000 and 9,500 people.

5. **Clue 5 Analysis**: The Sameos culture was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people. This helps us find the founding year of Sameos and the culture with 7,500 people.

### Deductions:
- From Clue 4 and 5, if Sameos was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people, and the culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people, we can start placing these cultures in years that are 250 years apart.

### Placing Cultures and Populations:
- If Sameos was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people, and considering the years available (100 AD, 350 AD, 600 AD, 850 AD), Sameos could be in 100 AD and the culture with 7,500 people in 350 AD.
- If the culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people, and 9,500 is after 4,500 (from Clue 2), then 5,000 could be in 100 AD or 350 AD, and 9,500 in 350 AD or 600 AD. But since Sameos is likely at 100 AD, 5,000 must be in 350 AD and 9,500 in 600 AD.
- From Clue 3, Budel is either 4,500 or 9,500 and linked to 600 AD. Since 9,500 is in 600 AD, Budel is 9,500 in 600 AD.
- Oiracha is not in 850 AD, not 4,500, leaving it likely at 850 AD with 7,500.

   - Since ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino, and we know from Clue 3, we can deduce the years for both ""Ultra Hex"" and Peter Powers once we figure out the year for one of them.

4. **Clue 2:** The hero who started in 2009 is either ""Criminal Bane"" or Peter Powers.
   - This means ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) must have started in 2010 because he can't be in 2009 if he's not one of these two options.

**Step 1: Assign known years to windmills based on direct clues.**
- From Clue 2: Grosmolen was built in 1729.
- From Clue 3: Vlietmolen was built in 1706.

**Step 2: Determine the years for the remaining windmills.**
- From Clue 1: Of the windmill built in 1729 and the windmill built in 1683, one is owned by the De Vries family and the other is Doesmolen. Since Grosmolen is already assigned to 1729, Doesmolen must be assigned to 1683.

**Step 3: Assign the remaining year to the remaining windmill.**
- The remaining windmill is Zemelmolen and the remaining year is 1752.

**Step 4: Assign families to windmills based on the years and remaining clues.**
- Since Grosmolen is in 1729 and Doesmolen is in 1683, and one of these is owned by the De Vries family (Clue 1), and since Grosmolen is already assigned, De Vries must be associated with Doesmolen in 1683.
- The remaining families for the remaining windmills are Bakker, Meijer, and Van Dijk.

**Step 5: Determine the family for the windmill built in 1752 using Clue 4.**
- Clue 4 states that the Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill. Since 1752 - 23 = 1729, and Grosmolen (1729) is already taken, Meijer must be associated with Grosmolen, and Bakker with Zemelmolen (1752).

**Step 6: Assign the remaining family to the remaining windmill.**
- The only remaining family is Van Dijk, and the only remaining windmill-year combination is Vlietmolen in 1706.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 4 and Clue 5**: Fushil was discovered before Teuz, and the island where Hakili lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm. This means Jujihm cannot be the earliest discovery (1754), as there must be a year that is 7 years earlier. Therefore, Hakili must be on an island discovered in 1754, and Jujihm in 1761.

2. **Clue 1 and Clue 2**: The island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Jujihm or Teuz. Since Jujihm is already associated with Hakili in 1761, Holo'oka must be on Teuz. From Clue 2, since Teuz is associated with Holo'oka and one of these (Holo'oka's island or the island discovered in 1761) was Fushil, and the other was Teuz, it means Fushil cannot be the island discovered in 1761. Therefore, Teuz was discovered in 1761, and Fushil must be the island where Holo'oka lived.

3. **Clue 3**: The island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived. Since Hakili is on an island discovered in 1754, Manika'i must be on an island discovered before 1754, which is not possible. Therefore, Manika'i must be on an island discovered after 1754. Since Teuz (1761) is taken by Holo'oka, Manika'i must be on the next available island, which is 1768.

4. **Remaining Assignments**: With Fushil (Holo'oka) in 1754, Teuz (Holo'oka) in 1761, and Jujihm (Hakili) in 1761, the only remaining island, Zafet, must be discovered in 1775. Since Hakili is in 1761 and Manika'i is in 1768, the remaining cultures for 1775 are Kukani.

### Final Answer:
- **1754 | Fushil | Holo'oka**

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Start with direct clues**:
   - Gene paid $7.75 (from clue 1).

2. **Apply relational clues**:
   - Rosa paid $1 more than the person who requested ginger (from clue 2). Since the prices are $6.75, $7.75, $8.75, $9.75, and Gene paid $7.75, Rosa must have paid $8.75.

3. **Use exclusion and relational clues**:
   - Rosa asked for chia seeds (from clue 4). Since Rosa paid $8.75 and asked for chia seeds, the person who requested ginger did not pay $8.75 but $7.75. Since Gene paid $7.75, Gene must have requested ginger.

4. **Resolve the remaining clues**:
   - From clue 3, of the person who requested acai berries and the customer who requested ginger, one paid $8.75 and the other is Delores. Since Gene (who requested ginger) paid $7.75, Delores must have requested acai berries and paid $9.75.

5. **Fill in the remaining details**:
   - The only remaining price is $6.75 and the only remaining superfood is kale. The only remaining customer is Betsy. Therefore, Betsy paid $6.75 and requested kale.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 5**
- The computer with 256 GB of hard drive space is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- The computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is somewhat smaller than Alejandro's build.
- From Clue 5, if 12 GB of RAM is associated with 256 GB, then Alejandro must have a larger hard drive. The only options larger than 256 GB are 384 GB and 512 GB.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's computer.
- This means Victor must have either 384 GB or 512 GB if the computer with 1 GB of RAM has 128 GB.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM.
- If the computer with 1 GB of RAM has 128 GB, then the computer with 4 GB of RAM must have 384 GB.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 1**
- Jack's computer is either the system with 256 GB of hard drive space or the build with 4 GB of RAM.
- Since the 4 GB of RAM is associated with 384 GB, Jack must have the 384 GB hard drive.

**Step 6: Deduce Remaining Assignments**
- Since Jack has 384 GB and 4 GB of RAM, and Victor's hard drive must be larger than 128 GB, Victor must have 512 GB.
- Alejandro, therefore, has the 256 GB hard drive (since it's larger than 128 GB but smaller than 384 GB and 512 GB).
- Otis gets the remaining 128 GB hard drive.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Start with Known Information**: From clue 1, we know Harry is the musician.

2. **Use Sequential Clues**: From clue 2, Dale has a birthday 1 month after Harry. Since we don't know Harry's birthday yet, we will keep this in mind for later.

3. **Linking Clues**: From clue 3, Adrian has a birthday 1 month after the surgeon. We don't know the surgeon's birthday yet, so we will keep this in mind.

4. **Further Linking**: From clue 4, the architect has a birthday 2 months after the surgeon. This clue will help us once we identify the surgeon's birthday.

5. **Deduction and Elimination**: Since Harry is the musician, Dale, Adrian, and Lamar must be either the architect, lawyer, or surgeon. Since Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry, and Adrian's birthday is 1 month after the surgeon, Adrian cannot be the surgeon. Therefore, Lamar must be the surgeon.

6. **Assigning Birthdays**: If Lamar is the surgeon, and Adrian's birthday is 1 month after Lamar, and the architect is 2 months after Lamar:
   - If Lamar's birthday is April 13th, Adrian's would be May 18th, and the architect would be June 14th. This leaves July 16th for Dale, which fits as it is 1 month after Harry's potential birthday in June 14th.

7. **Assigning Remaining Careers and Names**: Since Lamar is the surgeon, Adrian cannot be the surgeon and must be the architect (since his birthday follows the surgeon's by 2 months). Dale, therefore, must be the lawyer.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Analyzing Clue 2**: The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet. This implies Ellen's pet was not bought in January or February, and the macaw was not bought in March or April.

2. **Analyzing Clue 1**: One of the birds bought in February and January is Gladys's and the other is the macaw. Since the macaw cannot be in February or March (from Clue 2), it must be in January. Therefore, Gladys's pet is in February.

3. **Analyzing Clue 4**: Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet. Since Gladys's pet is in February, Alberta's pet must be in January.

4. **Analyzing Clue 3 and 5**: The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch (Clue 3), and the finch was bought sometime after the lovebird (Clue 5). This sequence suggests the lovebird was bought before the finch, and the finch before the parakeet.

5. **Placement of Birds**: Since the macaw is in January, the remaining months for the other birds based on Clues 3 and 5 are February, March, and April. The lovebird cannot be in April (as the finch and parakeet need to follow it), so it must be in February. The finch then goes to March, and the parakeet to April.

6. **Assigning Remaining Names**: Ellen's pet is 2 months after the macaw (January), so Ellen's pet is the finch in March. The remaining name for April (parakeet) is Della.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 4**: Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall.
   - Directly place Zeke's Spruce at 147 ft.

2. **Clue 1**: Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94 year-old tree.
   - We don't know the height of the 94 year-old tree yet, but we know Marsh Tree is 3 ft taller than it.

3. **Clue 2**: Of The Senator and Marsh Tree, one is 85 years old and the other is 153 ft. tall.
   - Since we don't have other information yet, we keep this in mind for cross-referencing later.

4. **Clue 3**: The Senator is taller than the 96 year-old tree.
   - This means The Senator cannot be the shortest tree, and it cannot be 96 years old.

Given the above, let's start placing:
- Since Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft, the remaining heights are 144 ft, 150 ft, and 153 ft.
- Since The Senator is taller than the 96-year-old tree, and Marsh Tree is 3 ft taller than the 94-year-old tree, we can start deducing:
   - If Marsh Tree were 153 ft, the 94-year-old tree would be 150 ft. This would leave 144 ft and 150 ft for the remaining trees.
   - Since The Senator is taller than the 96-year-old tree, The Senator cannot be 144 ft. Thus, The Senator must be 153 ft, and Marsh Tree must be 150 ft (3 ft taller than 150 ft, which is incorrect as per heights available). Therefore, Marsh Tree must be 150 ft, and the 94-year-old tree is 147 ft (which is taken by Zeke's Spruce, so this is incorrect).

Revising:
- If Marsh Tree is 150 ft, the 94-year-old tree must be 147 ft (taken by Zeke's Spruce, so this is incorrect).
- If Marsh Tree is 153 ft, the 94-year-old tree must be 150 ft. This fits as it leaves 144 ft for the 96-year-old tree, which The Senator cannot be as it is taller. Thus, The Senator is 153 ft, Marsh Tree is 150 ft, and the 96-year-old tree is 144 ft.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Analyzing Clue 1**: ""The camera made by Banion costs 25 dollars more than the DM-5000.""
   - This implies that the DM-5000 is priced at one of the three lower prices ($550, $575, $600) since Banion's camera must be priced higher by $25.

2. **Analyzing Clue 2**: ""Of the camera made by Honwa and the camera made by Banion, one is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550.""
   - This means either Honwa or Banion's camera is priced at $550 and the other is the Tela G5.

3. **Analyzing Clue 3**: ""The FC-520 costs 50 dollars more than the model made by Cober.""
   - This implies that the camera made by Cober is priced at one of the three lower prices ($550, $575, $600) since the FC-520 must be priced higher by $50.

### Deductions:
- If Banion's camera costs $25 more than the DM-5000, and considering the prices, if DM-5000 is $575, Banion's camera would be $600. But if DM-5000 is $550, Banion's camera would be $575. Since one of Banion or Honwa's cameras is $550, and the other is Tela G5, Banion cannot be $575 (as it would not allow for a $550 price). Thus, DM-5000 must be $550, Banion's camera is $575, and Honwa's camera is either $550 or Tela G5.

- Since the FC-520 is $50 more than Cober's camera, and Cober's camera cannot be $575 (as Banion's camera is $575), Cober's camera must be $550, making FC-520 $600.

- This leaves Honwa with the Tela G5 and the only remaining price, $625.

### Final Answer:
- $550 | Cober | DM-5000
- $575 | Banion | Tela G5

5. **Deduction 2**: Since the FC-520 is $50 more than Cober's camera, and Cober's camera cannot be $575 (as Banion's camera is $575), Cober's camera must be $550, making FC-520 $600.

6. **Deduction 3**: This leaves Honwa with the Tela G5 and the only remaining price, $625.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The camera made by Lirios is the Lectra 6.
   - Lirios = Lectra 6

2. **Clue 3**: Of the camera made by Torvia and the model made by Nectron, one is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550.
   - Torvia = Tela G5 or $550
   - Nectron = Tela G5 or $550

3. **Clue 1**: The camera made by Lirios costs $25 more than the model made by Torvia.
   - Since Lirios = Lectra 6, and it costs $25 more than Torvia, if Torvia is $550, then Lirios = $575.

4. **Clue 2**: The Zenix 2C costs more than the model made by Torvia.
   - Since Torvia could be $550, Zenix 2C must be more than $550.

5. **Clue 5**: The Tela G5 costs $25 more than the Zenix 2C.
   - If Zenix 2C is more than $550, and Tela G5 is $25 more, then Zenix 2C cannot be $550 or $575 (as Tela G5 would then be $600 or $625, respectively).

6. **Assigning Prices**:
   - Torvia = $550 (since it's the lowest and fits with Zenix 2C being more and Tela G5 being $25 more than Zenix 2C)
   - Zenix 2C = $600 (fits with being more than $550 and allows Tela G5 to be $625)
   - Tela G5 = $625 (as it's $25 more than Zenix 2C)
   - Lirios (Lectra 6) = $575 (as it's $25 more than Torvia)

7. **Assigning Remaining Company**:
   - Nectron must be Zenix 2C at $600 (since Torvia is Tela G5 at $550)

8. **Assigning Remaining Camera**:
   - Dayero must be DM-5000 at $625 (since all other cameras and prices are assigned)

### Final Answer:
- $550 | Torvia | Tela G5
- $575 | Lirios | Lectra 6

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 5**
- The beagle won 2 years before the pekingese.
- This means if the beagle won in 2006, the pekingese won in 2008. If the beagle won in 2007, the pekingese won in 2009.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Elsie's canine won in 2008.
- From Step 1, if the beagle won in 2006, then the pekingese (Elsie's dog) won in 2008.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 1**
- The canine that won in 2006, the beagle, and the maltese are all different dogs.
- Since the beagle won in 2006 and is different from the 2006 winner, the 2006 winner must be another breed.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Chester's canine is either the canine that won in 2006 or the beagle.
- Since the beagle won in 2006 and is different from the 2006 winner, Chester's dog cannot be the beagle. Therefore, Chester's dog is the 2006 winner.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the canine that won in 2009 and the dog that won in 2006, one is the pekingese and the other is Fernando's.
- Since the pekingese won in 2008 (Elsie's dog), Fernando's dog must be the 2009 winner.

**Step 6: Deduce Remaining Information**
- The remaining owner for 2007 is Barbara, and the remaining breed is the maltese.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 3 states that the March account and the sighting at Laurel Grove were different events.** This means Laurel Grove did not occur in March.

2. **Clue 1 states that of the sighting at Laurel Grove and Francis's account, one happened in March and the other in May.** Since Laurel Grove is not in March (from Clue 3), Laurel Grove must be in May and Francis's account must be in March.

3. **Clue 5 states that the sighting at Seryl Forest was either Wanda's event or the June event.** Since we don't have more information yet, we keep this in mind for later.

4. **Clue 2 states that Hannah's event took place 2 months after the account at Seryl Forest.** This means if Seryl Forest was in March, Hannah would be in May. But since May is already taken by Laurel Grove, Seryl Forest cannot be in March. If Seryl Forest was in April, Hannah would be in June.

5. **Clue 4 states that the account at Juniper Springs was either the April sighting or Hannah's sighting.** Since Hannah is in June (from Clue 2 and our deduction), Juniper Springs must be in April.

6. **From Clue 5 and our deductions, Seryl Forest must be in April (since it can't be in March and June is taken by Hannah).** This means Wanda's event is in April, as it's either Wanda's event or the June event.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis**: Peggy was born 6 minutes before the Underwoods' baby. This means Peggy's time must be exactly 6 minutes earlier than one of the times given. The only times that fit this clue are 12:01am for Peggy and 12:07am for the Underwoods' baby.

2. **Clue 3 Analysis**: The four babies were Maxine, the child born at 12:10am, the Blanchards' baby, and the baby born at 12:07am. Since we know the Underwoods' baby was born at 12:07am, this baby cannot be Maxine or the Blanchards' baby. Therefore, Maxine and the Blanchards' baby must be either the child born at 12:10am or another time.

3. **Clue 4 Analysis**: Of the Ortegas' child and the baby born at 12:10am, one was Luis and the other was Susan. Since we know the baby born at 12:07am is the Underwoods' baby, the baby born at 12:10am must be either Luis or Susan.

4. **Clue 2 Analysis**: The Ortegas' baby was either Susan or the child born at 12:04am. Since the baby born at 12:10am is either Luis or Susan, and one of them is the Ortegas' child, if Susan is the Ortega's baby, she must be born at 12:10am. This leaves Luis to be born at 12:04am.

5. **Remaining Assignments**: With Peggy at 12:01am, Luis at 12:04am, the Underwoods' baby (not Maxine or Blanchards) at 12:07am, and Susan (Ortegas) at 12:10am, the only remaining name for the 12:07am slot is Maxine. The Blanchards' baby must then be the one born at 12:04am (Luis).

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 3 (Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk):**
   - This clue establishes a direct relationship between the discovery years of Verinya and Nuhirk. Since the years are 1754, 1761, 1768, and 1775, the only possible pairs for a 7-year difference are 1754 (Verinya) and 1761 (Nuhirk) or 1768 (Verinya) and 1775 (Nuhirk).

2. **Clue 5 (Fushil was either the island discovered in 1768 or 1754):**
   - Fushil must be either in 1768 or 1754. Since Verinya and Nuhirk are already paired with a 7-year difference, Fushil cannot be Verinya or Nuhirk. Therefore, Fushil must be in 1768 or 1754, and Verinya and Nuhirk must be in 1754 and 1761 or 1768 and 1775 respectively.

3. **Clue 2 (Of the island on which the Kukani people lived and the island on which the Wainani people lived, one was discovered in 1761 and the other was Nuhirk):**
   - Since Nuhirk could be either 1761 or 1775, and one of these or 1761 must be where Kukani or Wainani lived, we can deduce that if Nuhirk is 1775, then the island discovered in 1761 (not Nuhirk) must be where either Kukani or Wainani lived.

4. **Clue 1 (Zafet was either the island on which the Kukani people lived or the island on which the Manika'i people lived):**
   - Since we know from Clue 2 that Kukani or Wainani was in 1761 and Nuhirk could be 1775, Zafet must be the other island (not Nuhirk) and thus must be in 1761.

5. **Clue 4 (The island on which the Enakai people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived):**
   - Since Zafet (1761) is either Kukani or Manika'i, and Enakai must be after Manika'i, Enakai cannot be in 1754. If Manika'i is in 1761, Enakai must be in a later year.

### Final Answer:
Based on the deductions and the clues, the table can be filled as follows:

- **1754 | Verinya | Wainani**
- **1761 | Zafet | Manika'i**
- **1768 | Fushil | Enakai**
- **1775 | Nuhirk | Kukani**

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Analyze Clue 1:** Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez, and the game released in May are all different apps. This means that Vitalinks isn't released by BeGamez and isn't the May release.

2. **Analyze Clue 2:** Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic. This establishes a direct sequential relationship between Apptastic's app and Wizard World.

3. **Analyze Clue 3:** Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka. This also sets a sequential relationship.

4. **Analyze Clue 4:** Of Peter Parka and the application released in May, one was made by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo. This clue will be more useful once we have more information about either Peter Parka or the May release.

### Deductions:
- From Clue 3 and the months available, if Angry Ants is in March, then Peter Parka must be in April. If Angry Ants is in April, then Peter Parka must be in May. If Angry Ants is in May, then Peter Parka must be in June. However, from Clue 1, Peter Parka cannot be in May.

- From Clue 2, if Apptastic's app is in March, Wizard World must be in April. If Apptastic's app is in April, Wizard World must be in May. If Apptastic's app is in May, Wizard World must be in June.

### Placing Apps:
- If Angry Ants is in March and Peter Parka in April, then from Clue 2, if Apptastic's app is in March, Wizard World would be in April, but Peter Parka is already placed in April. Thus, Apptastic's app cannot be in March. If Apptastic's app is in April, Wizard World would be in May, which fits.

### Final Placement:
- **March:** Angry Ants | Gadingo (since Apptastic's app is in April and Peter Parka is by Apptastic or Gadingo)
- **April:** Peter Parka | Apptastic
- **May:** Wizard World | Vortia (since BeGamez can't have Vitalinks and Wizard World is not by Apptastic)

5. **Deduction 1:** From Clue 3 and the months available, if Angry Ants is in March, then Peter Parka must be in April. If Angry Ants is in April, then Peter Parka must be in May. If Angry Ants is in May, then Peter Parka must be in June. However, from Clue 1, Peter Parka cannot be in May.
6. **Deduction 2:** From Clue 2, if Apptastic's app is in March, Wizard World must be in April. If Apptastic's app is in April, Wizard World must be in May. If Apptastic's app is in May, Wizard World must be in June.
7. **Placing Apps 1:** If Angry Ants is in March and Peter Parka in April, then from Clue 2, if Apptastic's app is in March, Wizard World would be in April, but Peter Parka is already placed in April. Thus, Apptastic's app cannot be in March. If Apptastic's app is in April, Wizard World would be in May, which fits.
8. **Final Placement:**
   - **March:** Angry Ants | Gadingo (since Apptastic's app is in April and Peter Parka is by Apptastic or Gadingo)
   - **April:** Peter Parka | Apptastic
   - **May:** Wizard World | Vortia (since BeGamez can't have Vitalinks and Wizard World is not by Apptastic)
   - **June:** Vitalinks | BeGamez

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 4 Analysis:** Charlie Group deployed 1 hour before India Group. This means Charlie cannot be at 11:00am and India cannot be at 8:00am.

2. **Clue 1 Analysis:** Charlie Group is either at 8:00am or at Ezra Forest. Since Charlie cannot be at 11:00am, if Charlie is at 8:00am, India must be at 9:00am (from Clue 4).

3. **Clue 2 Analysis:** Of the squad at Anthon Ridge and the team at 10:00am, one is Foxtrot and the other is India. Since India is at 9:00am, Foxtrot must be at 10:00am and the other (India) cannot be at Anthon Ridge. Thus, Anthon Ridge must be associated with the remaining team at 11:00am.

4. **Clue 3 Analysis:** Of the team at 9:00am and the squad at 10:00am, one is India and the other is at Crestline X. Since India is at 9:00am, Crestline X must be at 10:00am.

5. **Remaining Assignments:** With Charlie at 8:00am, India at 9:00am, Foxtrot at 10:00am, the only remaining slot for Whiskey is 11:00am. Since Anthon Ridge is at 11:00am, and Crestline X is at 10:00am, the remaining locations for 8:00am and 9:00am are Ezra Forest and Frazier Park. Since Charlie is either at 8:00am or Ezra Forest, and it is at 8:00am, it must be at Ezra Forest. Therefore, Frazier Park is at 9:00am.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Analyze Clue 3 and Clue 4**: Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed Alexander, and the sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days than Ed Alexander. This implies a relationship between the days taken by these sailors and helps establish a baseline for their finish times.

2. **Determine Ed Alexander's Possible Days**: Since the days available are 270, 274, 278, and 282, and knowing that Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed, Ed cannot have taken 282 days (as that would put Tara beyond the available days). If Ed took 278 days, Tara would take 282 days.

3. **Apply Clue 4**: If Ed took 278 days, the sailor in the pilot cutter, who took 4 fewer days, would have finished in 274 days.

4. **Apply Clue 2**: Of Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop, one finished in 270 days and the other in 278 days. Since Ed is taking 278 days, neither Vicky nor the sloop sailor can be Ed. If Vicky or the sloop sailor took 270 days, the other must take 278 days.

5. **Apply Clue 1**: Wendell Orr was either the sailor who finished in 270 days or the person in the gaff cutter. Since the pilot cutter finishes in 274 days, Wendell Orr cannot be in the pilot cutter.

6. **Assign Remaining Days and Boats**: With the remaining options and days, assign the boat types to the sailors based on the remaining unassigned days and avoiding any conflicts with the clues.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis:** ""The 'Night Ninjas' was ranked 1 place ahead of the 'Oil Crew'.""
   - This means if Night Ninjas are in position n, Oil Crew must be in position n+1.

2. **Clue 4 Analysis:** ""The 'Target Bombs' was ranked 1 place behind the orange team.""
   - This means if the orange team is in position m, Target Bombs must be in position m+1.

3. **Clue 2 Analysis:** ""The 'Splat Squad', the purple team, and the team that finished third are all different teams.""
   - Splat Squad cannot be third or purple.
   - The purple team cannot be third.

4. **Clue 3 Analysis:** ""Of the 'Oil Crew' and the group that finished third, one uses orange paintballs and the other uses red paintballs.""
   - Since Oil Crew and the third place team are different, one must be orange and the other red.

### Deductions:
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, if Night Ninjas are first, Oil Crew must be second. This would mean Target Bombs cannot be second (as they follow the orange team), so orange cannot be first. If orange is third, Target Bombs are fourth.
- If Splat Squad is not third or purple, and since third is either orange or red (Clue 3), Splat Squad cannot be orange or red. If purple is not third, purple must be either first, second, or fourth.

### Placing Teams:
- If Night Ninjas are first, Oil Crew second, orange is third (Oil Crew or third place), and Target Bombs fourth (behind orange), then:
  - Night Ninjas cannot be orange or red.
  - If Oil Crew is second and not purple (as purple is not third), they must be red.
  - Third place (orange) cannot be Oil Crew or Night Ninjas, so it must be Splat Squad.
  - Fourth (Target Bombs) must be purple.

2. **Clue 4 Analysis:** ""The 'Target Bombs' was ranked 1 place behind the orange team.""
   - This means if the orange team is in position m, Target Bombs must be in position m+1.

3. **Clue 2 Analysis:** ""The 'Splat Squad', the purple team, and the team that finished third are all different teams.""
   - Splat Squad cannot be third or purple.
   - The purple team cannot be third.

4. **Clue 3 Analysis:** ""Of the 'Oil Crew' and the group that finished third, one uses orange paintballs and the other uses red paintballs.""
   - Since Oil Crew and the third place team are different, one must be orange and the other red.

5. **Deductions:**
   - From Clue 1 and Clue 4, if Night Ninjas are first, Oil Crew must be second. This would mean Target Bombs cannot be second (as they follow the orange team), so orange cannot be first. If orange is third, Target Bombs are fourth.
   - If Splat Squad is not third or purple, and since third is either orange or red (Clue 3), Splat Squad cannot be orange or red. If purple is not third, purple must be either first, second, or fourth.

6. **Placing Teams:**
   - If Night Ninjas are first, Oil Crew second, orange is third (Oil Crew or third place), and Target Bombs fourth (behind orange), then:
     - Night Ninjas cannot be orange or red.
     - If Oil Crew is second and not purple (as purple is not third), they must be red.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the beverage that cost $3.60 and the iced americano, one was ordered by Henry and the other by Charlie.
- This means either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink, and the other ordered the iced americano.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The coffee ordered by Darrell cost 20 cents less than the beverage Charlie ordered.
- Since we know Charlie either ordered the $3.60 drink or the iced americano, we can deduce the possible prices for Darrell's drink based on the prices available.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The drink Jacob ordered cost 20 cents less than the espresso.
- This clue will help us once we determine the price of the espresso.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The vanilla latte cost somewhat more than the beverage ordered by Darrell.
- This helps us place the vanilla latte in a higher price bracket than Darrell's drink.

**Step 5: Deductions from Clues**
- If Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink, then Darrell's drink would be $3.40 (20 cents less). If Charlie ordered the iced americano, we need to determine its price to find Darrell's price.
- Since Jacob's drink is 20 cents less than the espresso, and the vanilla latte is more than Darrell's, we can start placing these drinks in the price grid.

**Step 6: Price Assignments**
- If Charlie has the $3.60 drink, then Henry has the iced americano. Let's assume the iced americano is not $3.50 (as it would make Jacob's drink $3.30, leaving no room for lower prices). If iced americano is $3.40, Jacob's drink can't be $3.20, so this assumption is incorrect.
- Therefore, Charlie must have the iced americano, and Henry has the $3.60 drink. Darrell's drink then is $3.40, and Jacob's drink, costing 20 cents less than the espresso, must be $3.30 if espresso is $3.50.

**Step 7: Final Placement**
- Darrell's drink at $3.40 cannot be the vanilla latte as it costs more than his drink. If espresso is $3.50, it fits neither Charlie nor Henry. Thus, Jacob has the $3.30 drink, and the only option left for Darrell is macchiato.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
- $3.30 | Jacob | macchiato
- $3.40 | Darrell | iced americano
- $3.50 | Charlie | espresso
- $3.60 | Henry | vanilla latte

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Amerigo made $6 million less than the movie directed by Hick Harmon. This means if Amerigo earned X, then Hick Harmon's movie earned X + $6 million.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo. If Amerigo earned X, then Zephyr Breeze earned X + $6 million.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The movie directed by Micah Moreno made somewhat more than Tippecanoe. This indicates that Micah Moreno's movie earned more than the movie Tippecanoe.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the movie directed by Nan Norman and Easy to Love, one made $11 million and the other made $2 million. This sets a clear distinction between two movies with the highest and the lowest earnings.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 4, we know that either Nan Norman's movie or Easy to Love made $11 million and the other made $2 million. 

- From Clue 1 and 2, we can deduce that if Amerigo made $X, then Zephyr Breeze made $X + $6 million. Since the only earnings that fit this pattern with the available options are $2 million for Amerigo and $8 million for Zephyr Breeze.

- Since Amerigo made $2 million, and from Clue 1, the movie directed by Hick Harmon made $2 million + $6 million = $8 million.

- From Clue 3, since Micah Moreno's movie made more than Tippecanoe, and the only amounts left are $5 million and $11 million, Micah Moreno's movie cannot be the lowest ($2 million), so it must be $11 million, and Tippecanoe must be $5 million.

### Assigning Directors:
- Amerigo ($2 million) cannot be directed by Hick Harmon (as his movie made $8 million). It also cannot be directed by Micah Moreno (as his movie made $11 million). If Easy to Love made $11 million, it must be directed by Micah Moreno, leaving Nan Norman to direct Amerigo.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis:**
   - ""Of the film that grossed $5 million and the movie that grossed $8 million, one is Fast and Dead and the other was directed by Linda Lynch.""
   - This means Fast and Dead either earned $5 million or $8 million, and Linda Lynch directed either the $5 million or $8 million movie.

2. **Clue 2 Analysis:**
   - ""Amerigo made 3 million less than Fast and Dead.""
   - If Fast and Dead earned $5 million, Amerigo earned $2 million. If Fast and Dead earned $8 million, Amerigo earned $5 million.

3. **Clue 3 Analysis:**
   - ""Amerigo is either the film that grossed $2 million or the film directed by Nan Norman.""
   - Combining with Clue 2, if Fast and Dead earned $8 million, Amerigo cannot earn $5 million and be directed by Nan Norman (since it would contradict the earnings). Therefore, Amerigo must have earned $2 million.

4. **Clue 4 Analysis:**
   - ""Of the film directed by Hick Harmon and the film that grossed $8 million, one is Easy to Love and the other is Fast and Dead.""
   - Since we deduced Fast and Dead earned $8 million, Easy to Love must be directed by Hick Harmon.

5. **Assigning Remaining Values:**
   - Amerigo earned $2 million and is directed by Nan Norman (from Clue 3).
   - Fast and Dead earned $8 million and is directed by Linda Lynch (from Clue 1 and Clue 4).
   - Easy to Love is directed by Hick Harmon and must earn $5 million (remaining option).
   - What a World earns $11 million (remaining option) and is directed by Odette Olson (remaining director).

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 3 Analysis:** The team that made it to 135 ft was either the Flying Eyes or the contestants that used the hybrid sling. This sets up two possibilities for 135 ft.

2. **Clue 5 Analysis:** Of the group that used the hybrid sling and the Russets, one scored a distance of 180 ft and the other scored a distance of 135 ft. Since one of these must be at 135 ft and the other at 180 ft, and from Clue 3, either Flying Eyes or hybrid sling is at 135 ft, we can deduce that if Flying Eyes is not at 135 ft, then hybrid sling must be, and vice versa for 180 ft.

3. **Clue 1 Analysis:** The contestants that used the trebuchet was either the group that made it to 150 ft or the Flying Eyes. Since we don't have enough information yet to place the Flying Eyes, we note this for future reference.

4. **Clue 2 Analysis:** The group that used the catapult landed 30 feet short of the team that used the slingshot. This clue will help us once we have more placements.

5. **Clue 4 Analysis:** The Spud Chuckers landed somewhat short of the Yukon Bolds. This means Spud Chuckers cannot be at the highest distance, and Yukon Bolds cannot be at the lowest.

6. **Combining Clues 3, 4, and 5:** If Flying Eyes are at 135 ft, then hybrid sling must be at 180 ft (from Clue 5). This would mean Russets are not at 135 ft or 180 ft. Since Spud Chuckers cannot be at the highest distance (Clue 4), they must be at 150 ft or 165 ft. If they are at 150 ft, Yukon Bolds must be at 165 ft or 180 ft. Since hybrid sling is at 180 ft, Yukon Bolds must be at 165 ft.

7. **Finalizing with Clue 2:** If catapult is 30 ft shorter than slingshot, and knowing the distances left (150 ft and 165 ft), catapult must be at 135 ft and slingshot at 165 ft.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person with 84 LinkedIn connections is either the person with 150 Facebook friends or Vickie.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the one with 150 Facebook friends and the one with 130 Facebook friends, one is Yvonne and the other has 84 LinkedIn connections.
- From Clue 1 and 3, we can deduce that the person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections. Yvonne is either the one with 150 Facebook friends or 130 Facebook friends.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari.
- This means Danny and Kari must have Facebook counts that are 20 apart (e.g., 120 and 140, 130 and 150).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections.
- This helps us establish a relative order between two sets of Facebook and LinkedIn connections.

**Step 5: Deductions and Assignments**
- Since Yvonne is either 150 or 130 on Facebook and the person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections, Yvonne must be the one with 130 Facebook friends.
- Vickie cannot be the one with 150 Facebook friends (as per Clue 1), so Vickie must have a different set of stats.
- Danny and Kari must fit into the remaining slots with Facebook friends that are 20 apart.

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis:** Haytouch interview is 2 days before the graphic design position. This means there must be at least two days between these events.

2. **Clue 4 Analysis:** Zathdrill interview is 2 days after the Haytouch interview. This sets a sequence and helps in placing these interviews on specific days.

3. **Clue 2 Analysis:** The interview for the social media position and the Laneplex interview are on August 23rd and August 20th. We need to determine which is on which day based on other clues.

4. **Clue 3 Analysis:** The janitor position is sometime after the Streeter Inc. interview. This clue will help in sequencing these two relative to others.

### Applying Clues:

- Since Haytouch is 2 days before the graphic design position and Zathdrill is 2 days after Haytouch, Haytouch cannot be on August 22nd or 23rd. If Haytouch is on August 20th, Zathdrill would be on August 22nd, and graphic design would be on August 22nd, which is not possible. Thus, Haytouch must be on August 21st, Zathdrill on August 23rd, and graphic design on August 23rd.

- From Clue 2, since Zathdrill is on August 23rd, Laneplex must be on August 20th. The remaining position on August 23rd (with Zathdrill) must be social media.

- From Clue 3, since Streeter Inc. must be before the janitor position and cannot be on August 20th (Laneplex) or August 21st (Haytouch), it must be on August 22nd. Thus, the janitor position is on August 23rd.

- The remaining company for August 21st is Haytouch, and the remaining position is tech support.

August 21st | Streeter Inc. | tech support
August 22nd | Zathdrill | graphic design
August 23rd | Laneplex | janitor","### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis:** Haytouch interview is 2 days before the graphic design position. This means there must be at least two days between these events.

2. **Clue 4 Analysis:** Zathdrill interview is 2 days after the Haytouch interview. This sets a sequence and helps in placing these interviews on specific days.

3. **Clue 2 Analysis:** The interview for the social media position and the Laneplex interview are on August 23rd and August 20th. We need to determine which is on which day based on other clues.

4. **Clue 3 Analysis:** The janitor position is sometime after the Streeter Inc. interview. This clue will help in sequencing these two relative to others.

### Applying Clues:

- Since Haytouch is 2 days before the graphic design position and Zathdrill is 2 days after Haytouch, Haytouch cannot be on August 22nd or 23rd. If Haytouch is on August 20th, Zathdrill would be on August 22nd, and graphic design would be on August 22nd, which is not possible. Thus, Haytouch must be on August 21st, Zathdrill on August 23rd, and graphic design on August 23rd.

- From Clue 2, since Zathdrill is on August 23rd, Laneplex must be on August 20th. The remaining position on August 23rd (with Zathdrill) must be social media.

- From Clue 3, since Streeter Inc. must be before the janitor position and cannot be on August 20th (Laneplex) or August 21st (Haytouch), it must be on August 22nd. Thus, the janitor position is on August 23rd.

- The remaining company for August 21st is Haytouch, and the remaining position is tech support.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The Friambliss was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir.
  - This means the vintage of Friambliss + 4 = vintage of pinot noir.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- The 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Ece Suss is either the 1992 bottle or the 1996 wine.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the pinot gris and the 1984 wine, one is the Annata Branco and the other is the Friambliss.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Zifennwein was bottled 4 years after the pinot gris.
  - This means the vintage of pinot gris + 4 = vintage of Zifennwein.

### Deductions:

- From Clue 5 and Clue 1, if we assume Friambliss is 1984 (from Clue 4), then pinot noir would be 1988. But then, Zifennwein can't be 1996 as it would contradict Clue 5 (since pinot gris + 4 = Zifennwein and pinot gris would then be 1992, leaving no room for Ece Suss as per Clue 3). Thus, Friambliss can't be 1984.
- If Friambliss is not 1984, then Annata Branco must be 1984 and pinot gris. This makes Friambliss 1992 and pinot noir 1996.
- From Clue 2, since pinot noir is 1996, it can't be Zifennwein, so 1996 must be syrah.
- This leaves Zifennwein to be 1988 (from the deduction that pinot gris + 4 = Zifennwein and pinot gris is 1984).
- Ece Suss then must be 1992, as it can't be 1996 (already syrah).

Fill the following table to show your final answer.

- Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau.

From Steps 1 and 2, we can infer that Alpha Beta Tau cannot have the lowest or the highest number of members because it needs both a fraternity with 3 fewer and 3 more members than itself. Therefore, Alpha Beta Tau must have 26 members, Beta Pi Omega must have 29 members, and the fraternity on Boom Court must have 23 members.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- The temple in Nakai was built 60 years after Yamasaki.
- This implies Yamasaki must be older than the shrine in Nakai.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Matsuno Okura was built 60 years after the shrine in Nakai.
- This establishes a sequence: Yamasaki -> Nakai -> Matsuno Okura, with each step separated by 60 years.

**Step 3: Determine the years for Yamasaki, Nakai, and Matsuno Okura**
- Given the 60-year intervals, possible sequences are:
  - Yamasaki in 1525, Nakai in 1585, Matsuno Okura in 1645
  - Yamasaki in 1585, Nakai in 1645, Matsuno Okura in 1705

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of Takahashi and the temple in Uchida, one was built in 1525 and the other in 1705.
- Since Matsuno Okura is either in 1645 or 1705, and it cannot be in Uchida (as it follows Nakai), Takahashi or the shrine in Uchida must be in 1525 or 1705.

**Step 5: Assign Yamasaki**
- If Yamasaki is in 1525, then Nakai must be in 1585 and Matsuno Okura in 1645. This leaves 1705 for Takahashi or the shrine in Uchida.
- If Yamasaki is in 1585, then Nakai must be in 1645 and Matsuno Okura in 1705. This leaves 1525 for Takahashi or the shrine in Uchida.

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 1**
- The structure in Niwa is either Amari Michi or Yamasaki.
- If Yamasaki is in 1525 or 1585, it fits that it could be in Niwa.

**Step 7: Final Assignments**
- If Yamasaki is in 1525 and in Niwa, then Nakai must have the shrine built in 1585, which cannot be Matsuno Okura or Yamasaki, leaving Amari Michi. Matsuno Okura then goes to 1645 in Uchida, and Takahashi goes to 1705 in Usui.

### Final Answer:
1525 | Yamasaki | Niwa  
1585 | Amari Michi | Nakai  
1645 | Matsuno Okura | Uchida  
1705 | Takahashi | Usui

"### Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 1 Analysis:** Of the K-9 unit assigned to Officer Yates and the canine that graduated in May, one was Jaws and the other was Hercules. This means Yates is paired with either Jaws or Hercules and the other dog graduated in May.

2. **Clue 2 Analysis:** Aries graduated sometime after Jaws. This means Jaws cannot be in June and Aries cannot be in March.

3. **Clue 3 Analysis:** The dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman. This sets a specific order and spacing between Nolan's and Zimmerman's dogs.

4. **Clue 4 Analysis:** The dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell. This means Fox's dog cannot be in June and Tinkerbell cannot be in March.

### Deductions:

- Since Jaws or Hercules is with Yates and one of them is in May, and Aries is after Jaws, Aries cannot be in May. Hercules or Jaws must be in May.
- Since Nolan's dog is 2 months before Zimmerman's, if Nolan's dog is in March, Zimmerman's must be in May. If Nolan's is in April, Zimmerman's is in June.

### Possible Scenarios:

- If Nolan's dog is in March and Zimmerman's in May, then Yates cannot be in May (as Yates has Jaws or Hercules). This means Yates must be in June, but this conflicts with Aries being after Jaws. Thus, Nolan cannot be in March.

- If Nolan's dog is in April and Zimmerman's in June, then Yates can be in May with either Jaws or Hercules. This fits all clues.

### Final Arrangement:

- **March:** Tinkerbell (since Fox is before Tinkerbell and Fox cannot be in June) | Fox

"**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Clue 4** states that the assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job. Since we don't have enough information yet to decide, we'll keep this in mind for later.

2. **Clue 1** states that the symposium event will involve 25 more people than Clarence's assignment. This means Clarence's event has fewer people than the symposium.

3. **Clue 2** states that of the symposium job and the graduation assignment, one will be handled by Mabel and the other will have 125 attendees. Since the symposium has more attendees than Clarence's event, Clarence cannot be handling the symposium or the graduation with 125 attendees.

4. **Clue 3** states that the retreat job will involve somewhat fewer people than the graduation job. This means the retreat has fewer attendees than the graduation.

5. **Clue 5** states that Patrice's assignment will involve 50 more people than the retreat assignment. This means Patrice's event has more attendees than the retreat.

**Assigning Numbers**:
- Since the symposium has 25 more attendees than Clarence's event, and one of the symposium or graduation has 125 attendees, let's assume the symposium has 125 attendees. This means Clarence's event must have 100 attendees (125 - 25 = 100).

**Assigning Planners**:
- Since Mabel handles either the symposium or the graduation, and the symposium has 125 attendees, Mabel must handle the symposium.
- Since Clarence's event has 100 attendees, Clarence must handle the graduation.

**Assigning Remaining Events**:
- Since the retreat has fewer attendees than the graduation (from Clue 3), and Patrice's event has 50 more attendees than the retreat (from Clue 5), Patrice cannot handle the retreat. Thus, Patrice handles the event with 50 attendees more than the retreat. If the retreat has 75 attendees, Patrice's event has 125 attendees, but since the symposium already has 125 attendees, this is incorrect. Therefore, the retreat must have 50 attendees, and Patrice handles the event with 100 attendees (graduation).
- Since the retreat has 50 attendees and is not handled by Mabel or Patrice, and Clarence handles the graduation, the retreat must be handled by the remaining planner, Glenda.
- Since the conference has not been assigned yet, and the only remaining number of attendees is 75, the conference must have 75 attendees and is handled by the remaining planner, which is Clarence.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 5**
- The yellow balloon cost 2 dollars less than the red balloon.
  - This sets a relationship between the prices of the yellow and red balloons. If yellow is $2 less than red, possible pairs are ($3.00, $5.00) or ($4.00, $6.00).

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- The dog cost 1 dollar more than the yellow piece.
  - This helps establish a price point for the dog relative to the yellow balloon. If yellow is $3.00, then the dog is $4.00; if yellow is $4.00, then the dog is $5.00.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- The snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.
  - This narrows down the price options for the snail to either $6.00 or $3.00.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red.
  - This clue helps determine the color and possibly the price of the cat. It also suggests that the $6.00 balloon is either the cat or another animal but not the snail if it's $3.00.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 1**
- The monkey cost more than the gold animal.
  - This indicates the monkey is priced higher than the balloon that is gold in color.

**Step 6: Deductions from Clues**
- From Clue 5, if the yellow balloon is $2 less than the red balloon, and considering the prices available, the only way this works is if the red balloon is $5.00 and the yellow balloon is $3.00.
- From Clue 3, since the dog costs $1 more than the yellow balloon, the dog must be $4.00.
- From Clue 4, since the snail must be either $6.00 or $3.00, and the yellow balloon is $3.00, the snail must be $6.00.
- From Clue 2, if the cat and the $6.00 balloon are either orange or red, and the snail is $6.00 and not red, the cat must be red and $5.00.
- From Clue 1, since the monkey costs more than the gold animal and the only remaining price higher than any other is $6.00, the monkey must be gold and $3.00.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
```
$3.00 | monkey | gold
$4.00 | dog    | yellow

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Velma Vintz's book costs $10 less than Tara Tyne's book.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The calculus book costs $5 more than Velma Vintz's book.

**Step 3: Combine Clues 1 and 2**
- If Velma's book costs $X, then Tara's book costs $X + $10, and the calculus book costs $X + $5.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 5**
- The pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the algebra book and the $39.99 title, one is by Pat Peterson and the other by Tara Tyne.

**Step 6: Deduce from Clue 3**
- The field theory book costs more than Mina Morton's book.

**Step 7: Price Assignments**
- Since the calculus book costs $5 more than Velma's book and $10 less than Tara's book, and considering the prices available, we can start assigning possible prices:
  - If Velma's book is $24.99, then calculus would be $29.99, and Tara's book would be $34.99.
  - If Velma's book is $29.99, then calculus would be $34.99, and Tara's book would be $39.99.

**Step 8: Check for contradictions**
- If Tara's book is $39.99 and it's either algebra or $39.99, then Tara must have written the algebra book, and it must be $39.99. This fits with Clue 4.

**Step 9: Finalize assignments**
- Since Tara's book is $39.99 and algebra, and Velma's book is $29.99 with calculus at $34.99, Mina Morton's book must be cheaper than the field theory book. Thus, Mina Morton's book is $24.99, and the field theory book is $34.99.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Apply Clue 1**
- Methuselah is 32 years old.
  - Methuselah | 32 | (species unknown yet)

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- The two rimmed tortoise is 36 years older than the horned tortoise.
  - Since the ages available are 14, 32, 50, and 68, and the difference must be 36 years, the possible pairs are (32, 68) or (14, 50). However, since Methuselah is 32 and not a two rimmed tortoise, the pair must be (14, 50).
  - Horned | 14 | (tortoise unknown yet)
  - Two rimmed | 50 | (tortoise unknown yet)

**Step 3: Apply Clue 3**
- Chewie is either the pitch belly tortoise or the 50-year-old one.
  - Since the 50-year-old is the two rimmed tortoise, Chewie must be the pitch belly tortoise.
  - Chewie | (age unknown yet) | pitch belly

**Step 4: Apply Clue 4**
- Of the black neck tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise, one is 68 years old and the other is named Shelly.
  - Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, the black neck tortoise must be 68 years old.
  - Shelly | (age unknown yet) | two rimmed
  - (tortoise unknown yet) | 68 | black neck

**Step 5: Deduce Remaining Assignments**
- Since Methuselah is 32 and not linked to a species yet, and Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise, Shelly is the two rimmed tortoise, the remaining tortoise Yoda must be the horned tortoise.
  - Yoda | 14 | horned
- Since Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise and the only ages left are 50 and 68, and 50 is taken by the two rimmed tortoise, Chewie must be 68 years old.
  - Chewie | 68 | pitch belly
- Shelly, being the two rimmed tortoise, must be 50 years old.
  - Shelly | 50 | two rimmed

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Species to Methuselah**
- The remaining species for Methuselah, since all others have been assigned, is black neck.
  - Methuselah | 32 | black neck

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

50 | Shelly | black neck
68 | Yoda | two rimmed","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Apply Clue 1**
- Methuselah is 32 years old.
  - Methuselah | 32 | (species unknown yet)

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- The two rimmed tortoise is 36 years older than the horned tortoise.
  - Since the ages available are 14, 32, 50, and 68, and the difference must be 36 years, the possible pairs are (32, 68) or (14, 50). However, since Methuselah is 32 and not a two rimmed tortoise, the pair must be (14, 50).
  - Horned | 14 | (tortoise unknown yet)
  - Two rimmed | 50 | (tortoise unknown yet)

**Step 3: Apply Clue 3**
- Chewie is either the pitch belly tortoise or the 50-year-old one.
  - Since the 50-year-old is the two rimmed tortoise, Chewie must be the pitch belly tortoise.
  - Chewie | (age unknown yet) | pitch belly

**Step 4: Apply Clue 4**
- Of the black neck tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise, one is 68 years old and the other is named Shelly.
  - Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, the black neck tortoise must be 68 years old.
  - Shelly | (age unknown yet) | two rimmed
  - (tortoise unknown yet) | 68 | black neck

**Step 5: Deduce Remaining Assignments**
- Since Methuselah is 32 and not linked to a species yet, and Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise, Shelly is the two rimmed tortoise, the remaining tortoise Yoda must be the horned tortoise.
  - Yoda | 14 | horned
- Since Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise and the only ages left are 50 and 68, and 50 is taken by the two rimmed tortoise, Chewie must be 68 years old.
  - Chewie | 68 | pitch belly
- Shelly, being the two rimmed tortoise, must be 50 years old.
  - Shelly | 50 | two rimmed

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Species to Methuselah**
- The remaining species for Methuselah, since all others have been assigned, is black neck.
  - Methuselah | 32 | black neck
