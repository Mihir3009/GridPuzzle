"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Facts**
- From Clue 6: The 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.
- From Clue 3: The 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.

**Step 2: Use Direct Clues**
- From Clue 2: The Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means if Bianca Flaux is 1992, then Vendemmia is 1996.
- From Clue 5: The Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.
- From Clue 1: The Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.

**Step 3: Process of Elimination**
- Since the 1984 bottle is gewurztraminer and the 1988 bottle is pinot noir, the remaining types for 1992 and 1996 are merlot and riesling.
- From Clue 4: The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.

**Step 4: Cross-Verification**
- Since the Bianca Flaux is after the Ece Suss and the Ece Suss is after the Annata Branco, the only possible sequence that fits is Annata Branco -> Ece Suss -> Bianca Flaux -> Vendemmia.
- Given the sequence and the years between Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia (4 years), and knowing the years of the wines, we can assign:
  - Annata Branco to 1984 (gewurztraminer)
  - Ece Suss to 1988 (pinot noir)
  - Bianca Flaux to 1992 (merlot)
  - Vendemmia to 1996 (riesling)

"Step-by-step solution:
- From clue 3, the altissimo won fourth place.
- From clue 1, the rose that won fourth place was Hannah's. Since altissimo is in fourth place, it belongs to Hannah.
- From clue 2, the flower that won second place, the calocarpa, and the bon silene were all different flowers. Since altissimo is already in fourth place, it cannot be any of these.
- From clue 4, the bon silene finished 1 place ahead of Tricia's rose. Since bon silene and Tricia's rose are consecutive, and bon silene is not second or fourth (from clue 2 and altissimo being fourth), bon silene must be third and Tricia's rose second.
- From clue 5, the bon silene finished 2 places ahead of Nellie's flower. Since bon silene is third, Nellie's flower must be first.
- Since calocarpa is different from the second and third place flowers (from clue 2), and altissimo is fourth, calocarpa must be first.
- The remaining rose, perle d'or, must be second.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4**
- Clue 2 states that Galen scored 62%.
- Clue 4 states that Proclus scored 76%.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the A.I. that scored 76% was either Galen or the system from Oxford. Since Galen scored 62%, it must be Proclus from Oxford who scored 76%.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- Clue 5 states that the system that scored 55% was either the system from CIT or Zeno. Since Proclus is from Oxford and Galen scored 62%, we need to determine between Zeno and the remaining institution for the 55% score.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA. Since UCLA cannot be 76% (Proclus, Oxford) or 62% (Galen), UCLA must be associated with either 55% or 69%. If UCLA were 55%, Zeno would be 62%, but Galen is already 62%. Therefore, UCLA must be 69%, and Zeno must be 76%.

**Step 5: Assign Remaining Scores and Institutions**
- Since Zeno is 76% and associated with Oxford, and Proclus is also 76% but already assigned to Oxford, Zeno must be from another institution. Since UCLA is 69%, the remaining institution for Zeno is CIT.
- The system from CIT scored 55% as per Clue 5, and since Zeno is 76%, the system from CIT must be Archimedes.

**Step 6: Finalize the Table**
- Galen scored 62% and is not from Oxford or UCLA, so Galen must be from Exeter.
- The remaining score of 55% goes to Archimedes from CIT.
- Proclus is 76% from Oxford.
- Zeno is 76% from CIT.
- The system from UCLA scored 69% and must be the remaining A.I., which is Archimedes.

### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Apply Clue 2**
- Tracy's letter was sent in 1962.
  - 1962 | Tracy | ?

**Step 2: Apply Clue 5**
- Sean's bottle was from Le Havre.
  - ? | Sean | Le Havre

**Step 3: Apply Clue 4**
- Sean's missive is either the letter that was sent in 1983 or the message that was sent in 1962.
  - Since Tracy's letter was sent in 1962, Sean's letter must be sent in 1983.
  - 1983 | Sean | Le Havre

**Step 4: Apply Clue 1**
- The message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg.
  - Since we don't know the exact years yet, we'll keep this in mind for later.

**Step 5: Apply Clue 3**
- The bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive.
  - Since Tracy's letter was sent in 1962 and not from Plymouth, Karla's bottle must be from Plymouth.
  - ? | Karla | Plymouth

**Step 6: Apply Clue 1 with Known Information**
- Since Karla's bottle is from Plymouth, and it must be 14 years after Cherbourg, we need to find a year that fits this rule.
  - If Cherbourg was in 1969, Plymouth would be in 1983. But since 1983 is taken by Le Havre, this is incorrect.
  - If Cherbourg was in 1962, Plymouth would be in 1976. This fits as 1976 is available.
  - 1976 | Karla | Plymouth
  - 1962 | Tracy | Cherbourg

**Step 7: Fill in Remaining Gaps**
- We have left 1969 and 1983 for origins and Felipe for writers.
  - Since 1983 is taken by Sean and Le Havre, and 1962 and 1976 are taken by Tracy/Cherbourg and Karla/Plymouth respectively, Felipe must be in 1969.
  - The only origin left for 1969 is Bournemouth.
  - 1969 | Felipe | Bournemouth

"Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 2, we know that the April 17 outing was in Gilmore City.
2. From Clue 3, the outing where they saw 16 shooting stars was in Gilmore City. Combining this with Clue 2, the outing on April 17 saw 16 shooting stars in Gilmore City.

3. From Clue 4, the April 10 outing logged 7 more shooting stars than the April 22 outing. Since we know the numbers of shooting stars are 2, 9, 16, and 23, and 16 is already used on April 17, the only way to have a difference of 7 is between 9 and 2 or 23 and 16. Since 16 is already used on April 17, April 10 must have 9 shooting stars and April 22 must have 2 shooting stars.

4. From Clue 1, the outing to Eastbrook logged 7 fewer shooting stars than the trip to Isleton. Since we have 2 and 9 left for the shooting stars and 16 is already used, the only remaining numbers are 2 and 23. Since 2 is already used on April 22, Eastbrook must have 2 shooting stars and Isleton must have 9 shooting stars.

4. Since Owens is staying for 3 days, and Parker stays 1 day longer than the guest in room 314, room 314 cannot be 3 days (as Parker would then be 4 days, which is not an option). Therefore, room 314 must be either 2 or 4 days.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Values from Clues**
- From Clue 3, Stuart lost 7 lbs.
- From Clue 5, Wesley lost 5 lbs.

**Step 2: Use Deductive Reasoning**
- From Clue 1, since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet must have lost 7 - 4 = 3 lbs.
- From Clue 4, since Stuart lost 7 lbs and the clue states that the person who lost 7 lbs is either the person who used the caveman diet or Raymond, and since Stuart is not Raymond, Stuart must be on the caveman diet.
- From Clue 2, since the gluten-free dieter lost 2 more pounds than Raymond, we need to find Raymond's weight loss to use this clue.

**Step 3: Eliminate Conflicts and Fill Remaining Slots**
- Since Stuart lost 7 lbs and is on the caveman diet, and Wesley lost 5 lbs, the remaining pounds lost are 3 and 9.
- Since the vegan diet corresponds to 3 lbs (from Step 2), and Wesley lost 5 lbs, Wesley cannot be on the vegan diet.
- Since Stuart is not Raymond and he lost 7 lbs, Raymond must have lost either 3 or 9 lbs. From Clue 2, the gluten-free dieter lost more than Raymond, so Raymond cannot have lost 9 lbs. Therefore, Raymond lost 3 lbs, and the gluten-free dieter lost 5 lbs.
- Since Wesley lost 5 lbs and the gluten-free dieter lost 5 lbs, Wesley followed the gluten-free diet.
- The remaining pounds lost (9 lbs) must be associated with Tom, and the only diet left is dairy-free.

**Step 4: Verify Consistency**
- Check all clues with the final arrangement to ensure no contradictions.

```
This arrangement satisfies all the clues and the conditions of the puzzle.","3 | Raymond | vegan
5 | Wesley | gluten-free
7 | Stuart | caveman
9 | Tom | dairy-free","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Values from Clues**
- From Clue 3, Stuart lost 7 lbs.
- From Clue 5, Wesley lost 5 lbs.

**Step 2: Use Deductive Reasoning**
- From Clue 1, since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet must have lost 7 - 4 = 3 lbs.
- From Clue 4, since Stuart lost 7 lbs and the clue states that the person who lost 7 lbs is either the person who used the caveman diet or Raymond, and since Stuart is not Raymond, Stuart must be on the caveman diet.
- From Clue 2, since the gluten-free dieter lost 2 more pounds than Raymond, we need to find Raymond's weight loss to use this clue.

**Step 3: Eliminate Conflicts and Fill Remaining Slots**
- Since Stuart lost 7 lbs and is on the caveman diet, and Wesley lost 5 lbs, the remaining pounds lost are 3 and 9.
- Since the vegan diet corresponds to 3 lbs (from Step 2), and Wesley lost 5 lbs, Wesley cannot be on the vegan diet.
- Since Stuart is not Raymond and he lost 7 lbs, Raymond must have lost either 3 or 9 lbs. From Clue 2, the gluten-free dieter lost more than Raymond, so Raymond cannot have lost 9 lbs. Therefore, Raymond lost 3 lbs, and the gluten-free dieter lost 5 lbs.
- Since Wesley lost 5 lbs and the gluten-free dieter lost 5 lbs, Wesley followed the gluten-free diet.
- The remaining pounds lost (9 lbs) must be associated with Tom, and the only diet left is dairy-free.

**Step 4: Verify Consistency**
- Check all clues with the final arrangement to ensure no contradictions.

"Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 1, Yvette's purchase was either the insect that sold for $45 or the peacock butterfly. This means Yvette did not buy the butterfly that sold for $60, $75, or $90.

2. From Clue 2, the swallowtail butterfly cost $15 more than Phillip's purchase. This clue will be used later to determine the exact prices once we have more information.

3. From Clue 3, the atlas butterfly cost more than the peacock butterfly. This sets a hierarchy in pricing between these two butterflies.

4. From Clue 4, the four butterflies were the butterfly that sold for $90, the grayling butterfly, Yvette's purchase, and Walter's purchase. This clue confirms that Walter did not buy the butterfly that sold for $45 if that was Yvette's purchase.

Let's start solving:
1. Since Yvette's purchase was either $45 or the peacock, and the peacock must cost less than the atlas (from Clue 3), we can deduce that Yvette bought the butterfly for $45, as the peacock cannot be the cheapest option.

2. Since the swallowtail costs $15 more than Phillip's purchase (from Clue 2), and we know the prices are $45, $60, $75, and $90, we need to find a fit. If Phillip bought the butterfly for $60, then the swallowtail would cost $75.

3. From Clue 3, since the atlas costs more than the peacock and the swallowtail is $75, the atlas must be $90, as it is the only higher price left.

4. From Clue 4, since Walter's purchase is listed and Yvette bought the $45 butterfly, Walter must have bought either the $60, $75, or $90 butterfly. Since the atlas is $90 and costs more than the peacock, Walter must have bought the atlas.

5. Since the swallowtail is $75 and Phillip's purchase leads to the swallowtail being $15 more, Phillip must have bought the butterfly for $60.

6. The remaining butterfly, the peacock, must then be the remaining price, which is $75. Since Phillip bought the $60 butterfly, Otis must have bought the peacock for $75.

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Understand and Apply Direct Clues**
- Clue 3 states that Eugene will depart from Farley. This gives us a direct name and departure match.

**Step 2: Apply Clue 1**
- Since Eugene departs from Farley, and according to Clue 1, the person departing from Farley leaves 2 days before the person departing from Hardwick, we can determine the relative days for these departures.

**Step 3: Create and Fill the Grid**
- We know Eugene departs from Farley. We need to find a suitable day for Eugene that allows the person departing from Hardwick to leave 2 days later.

**Step 4: Deduce Relationships Using Remaining Clues**
- Clue 4 states that the conductor departing from Epworth will leave 1 day after Mitchell. This helps us place Mitchell and the Epworth departure relative to each other.

**Step 5: Check for Possible Days**
- Since there are only four days (June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13), and Eugene (departing from Farley) needs to leave 2 days before the Hardwick departure, Eugene cannot depart on June 12 or June 13 (as this would not leave room for a 2-day gap). Thus, Eugene must depart on June 10 or June 11.

**Step 6: Finalize the Grid**
- If Eugene departs on June 10 from Farley, then the Hardwick departure must be on June 12.
- Mitchell cannot be on June 12 since the Epworth departure is the day after Mitchell. Thus, Mitchell must be on June 11, and the Epworth departure on June 12.
- This leaves June 13 for the last departure, which is Jackman, and the only remaining conductor, Roderick.

"Step-by-step solution:
1. **From Clue 3**: Kurt Koch is the defensive end.
2. **From Clue 4**: Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker. Since games are 3, 4, 5, 6, Koch must have played one of these minus 2.
3. **From Clue 2**: The person who played in 5 games is the quarterback. This sets one game and position.
4. **From Clue 1**: Edward Ellis played 2 more games than the defensive end. Since Koch is the defensive end, we need to find his game number to determine Ellis's.
5. **From Clue 5**: The running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games. This clue will be used later to confirm the identity once more positions are set.

Using these clues:
- Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end and played 2 fewer games than the placekicker, and the quarterback played 5 games, Koch cannot have played 5. If Koch played 3 games (the lowest), the placekicker played 5 games. But since the quarterback is already in game 5, Koch must have played in 4 games, making the placekicker in game 6.
- Edward Ellis, playing 2 more games than Koch (defensive end), must have played in 6 games.
- The quarterback played in 5 games, and since Edward Ellis is in game 6 and Koch in game 4, Jack Jensen must be the quarterback in game 5.

"Step-by-step solution:
- From clue 1, Violet has a boxer.
- From clue 2, Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu. This means the shih tzu was adopted in either January or February, as the latest Kayla's pet could be adopted is April.
- From clue 3, Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab. This means the black lab was adopted in either February, March, or April.
- From clue 4, Rosie's pet, the dog adopted in April, the puppy adopted in February, and the puppy adopted in March are all different. This means Rosie's pet is not adopted in February, March, or April.

Let's start placing the information:
- Since Rosie's pet is not adopted in February, March, or April, Rosie's pet must be adopted in January.
- Since the black lab is adopted 1 month after Rosie's pet (clue 3), the black lab is adopted in February.
- Since Kayla's pet is adopted 2 months after the shih tzu, and the shih tzu cannot be adopted in March (as that would place Kayla's pet in May, which is not an option), the shih tzu must be adopted in January, and Kayla's pet in March.
- Since Violet has the boxer (clue 1), and the boxer cannot be the pet adopted in January (as it's Rosie's pet), February (as it's the black lab), or March (as it's Kayla's pet), Violet's boxer must be adopted in April.
- This leaves Lydia with the remaining month, February, and the remaining dog breed, schnauzer.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Information**
- From Clue 1: Gracie is 11 years old.
- From Clue 5: The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 12 years old.

**Step 2: Use Deductive Reasoning**
- From Clue 3: The 11-year-old condor (Gracie) has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old bird. Since the 11-year-old is Gracie, we need to find the wingspan of the 9-year-old and subtract 4 inches for Gracie.
- From Clue 4: The 9-year-old condor is either the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches or Angel. But from Clue 5, the 114-inch wingspan bird is 12 years old, so the 9-year-old must be Angel.
- Since Angel is the 9-year-old, and Gracie is 11 years old with a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old, we need to find the wingspan of Angel (9 years old) that allows for this difference.
- From Clue 2: The four condors are the 9-year-old condor, the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches, Buddy, and the condor with a wingspan of 110 inches. Since Angel is the 9-year-old, Angel cannot have a wingspan of 102 inches or 110 inches.
- Since Angel is 9 years old and cannot have the wingspans of 102 or 110 inches, and 114 inches is for the 12-year-old, Angel must have a wingspan of 106 inches. Therefore, Gracie (11 years old) must have a wingspan of 106 - 4 = 102 inches.

**Step 3: Fill Remaining Information**
- Buddy must be either the bird with a wingspan of 110 inches or 102 inches. Since Gracie is already assigned to 102 inches, Buddy must have a wingspan of 110 inches.
- The remaining wingspan, 114 inches, is already assigned to a 12-year-old, and the remaining name is Smokey.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Information**
- From Clue 2: Disty launched in March.

**Step 2: Use Sequential Clues**
- From Clue 5: The Iunsel launched 1 month before the mission going to Uranus.
- From Clue 4: The Iunsel is going to Pluto.
- From Clue 3: The Moro Jaddo launched 1 month after the mission going to Uranus.

**Step 3: Deduce by Elimination**
- Since Iunsel launched 1 month before Uranus and is going to Pluto, and Disty launched in March:
  - Iunsel cannot be in March (Disty is in March).
  - If Iunsel is in February, then the Uranus mission is in March. This fits as Disty is in March but does not go to Uranus.
  - Therefore, Iunsel is in February going to Pluto, and the Uranus mission is in March with Disty.
- From Clue 1: The Iunsel launched sometime after the probe going to Mercury.
  - Since Iunsel is in February, the Mercury mission must be in January.
- Moro Jaddo launched 1 month after Uranus, which places Moro Jaddo in April.

**Step 4: Fill Remaining Slots**
- The only remaining month is January for the probe going to Mercury.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Clue Interpretation**
- Clue 1: The reporter on April 7th, the reporter who covered the solar eclipse, the journalist who covered the earthquake, and Randy Reid are all different individuals.
- Clue 2: Sid Snyder left 1 day after Tam Terry.
- Clue 3: Randy Reid left 1 day after the journalist who covered the solar eclipse.
- Clue 4: Linda Lott left 1 day before the journalist who covered the flooding.

**Step 2: Initial Deductions**
- From Clue 1, Randy Reid cannot be the reporter on April 7th, nor can he cover the solar eclipse or the earthquake.
- From Clue 3, Randy Reid cannot be on April 4th (the earliest day), and the solar eclipse cannot be on April 7th (the latest day).

**Step 3: Sequential Deductions**
- From Clue 2, Sid Snyder must be on the day immediately following Tam Terry.
- From Clue 3, Randy Reid must be on the day immediately following the solar eclipse.
- From Clue 4, Linda Lott must be on the day immediately before the flooding.

**Step 4: Process of Elimination**
- Since Randy Reid cannot be on April 7th, and he follows the solar eclipse, the latest Randy Reid can be is April 6th, which places the solar eclipse on April 5th.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Information**
- From Clue 1: Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower.
- From Clue 4: The person with the $15.50 fare was picked up at the Camlin Hotel.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning**
- From Clue 3: Della was either the client with the $12.50 fare or the person who got picked up at the Seattle Tower. Since Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower, Della must be the client with the $12.50 fare.
- From Clue 2: Elvira paid $6 less than the customer who got picked up at the Moore Mansion. Since the fares are $6.50, $9.50, $12.50, and $15.50, and Elvira paid $6 less, she must have paid $6.50. The only fare $6 more than $6.50 is $12.50, but since Della has the $12.50 fare, the next possible fare for the Moore Mansion pickup is $15.50. However, since the Camlin Hotel already has the $15.50 fare, the Moore Mansion must be associated with the $9.50 fare, and Elvira cannot be associated with the Moore Mansion. Thus, Elvira must be associated with a different location.

**Step 3: Process of Elimination**
- Since Wayne is at Seattle Tower and Della has the $12.50 fare, and Elvira has the $6.50 fare, the remaining fare for Wayne is $9.50. 
- The remaining customer, Isabel, must then have the $15.50 fare and be picked up at the Camlin Hotel.
- The remaining pickup point for Elvira is Neptune Theatre.

**Step 4: Verify Consistency**
- Check all clues and ensure no conflicts:
  - Clue 1 and 3 are satisfied as Wayne is at Seattle Tower and Della has the $12.50 fare.
  - Clue 2 is satisfied as Elvira paid $6.50 and the Moore Mansion has the $9.50 fare.

- From Clue 5: The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin.

**Step 2: Use Direct Implications**
- From Clue 4: Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car. Since the sports car is not delivered on October 7 (bowling pin), it must be on another date.
- From Clue 1: Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the sports car. Since the sports car is not on October 7, it must be on October 8, making Mrs. Danielson's delivery on October 6.

**Step 3: Eliminate Conflicts**
- From Clue 3: The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake. Since October 7 is taken by the bowling pin, Mrs. Ingram's cake cannot be the bowling pin. Therefore, the October 5 delivery must be the bowling pin.
- From Clue 2: The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake. Since Mrs. Ingram's cake is not on October 7 or October 8, it must be on October 8 (the only remaining date for Mrs. Ingram after considering other clues).

"**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Using Clue 3**: The nibner newt was recognized as endangered in 2006.
   - 2006 | nibner newt | ?

2. **Using Clue 1**: The nibner newt was listed 2 years before the species with a population size of 385.
   - Since the nibner newt was listed in 2006, the species with a population size of 385 must have been listed in 2008.
   - 2008 | ? | 385

3. **Using Clue 4**: The species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.
   - Since 2008 has a population of 385, it must be either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.
   - 2008 | perens pig or osbele oryx | 385

4. **Using Clue 2**: The perens pig is either the animal added to the list in 2006 or the species with a population size of 315.
   - Since the nibner newt is already assigned to 2006, the perens pig cannot be in 2006. Therefore, the perens pig must have a population of 315.
   - Since the perens pig cannot be in 2006 and 2008 already has a species with a population of 385, the perens pig must be in 2007.
   - 2007 | perens pig | 315

5. **Using Clue 4 and previous deduction**: Since the perens pig is now assigned to 2007 with a population of 315, the species in 2008 with a population of 385 must be the osbele oryx.
   - 2008 | osbele oryx | 385

6. **Using Clue 5**: The perens pig was listed sometime before the species with a population size of 210.
   - Since the perens pig is in 2007, the species with a population of 210 must be in 2009.
   - 2009 | ? | 210

7. **Remaining species and population**: The only remaining species is the eldar elk and the only remaining population is 280.
   - Since 2009 has a population of 210, the remaining species for 2009 must be the eldar elk.
   - The remaining year, 2006, already has the nibner newt, so the remaining population for 2006 must be 280.
   - 2006 | nibner newt | 280
   - 2009 | eldar elk | 210

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

2. **Using Clue 1**: The nibner newt was listed 2 years before the species with a population size of 385.
   - Since the nibner newt was listed in 2006, the species with a population size of 385 must have been listed in 2008.
   - 2008 | ? | 385

3. **Using Clue 4**: The species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.
   - Since 2008 has a population of 385, it must be either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.
   - 2008 | perens pig or osbele oryx | 385

4. **Using Clue 2**: The perens pig is either the animal added to the list in 2006 or the species with a population size of 315.
   - Since the nibner newt is already assigned to 2006, the perens pig cannot be in 2006. Therefore, the perens pig must have a population of 315.
   - Since the perens pig cannot be in 2006 and 2008 already has a species with a population of 385, the perens pig must be in 2007.
   - 2007 | perens pig | 315

5. **Using Clue 4 and previous deduction**: Since the perens pig is now assigned to 2007 with a population of 315, the species in 2008 with a population of 385 must be the osbele oryx.
   - 2008 | osbele oryx | 385

6. **Using Clue 5**: The perens pig was listed sometime before the species with a population size of 210.
   - Since the perens pig is in 2007, the species with a population of 210 must be in 2009.
   - 2009 | ? | 210

7. **Remaining species and population**: The only remaining species is the eldar elk and the only remaining population is 280.
   - Since 2009 has a population of 210, the remaining species for 2009 must be the eldar elk.
   - The remaining year, 2006, already has the nibner newt, so the remaining population for 2006 must be 280.
   - 2006 | nibner newt | 280
   - 2009 | eldar elk | 210

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
2006 | nibner newt | 280

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998. This establishes a direct relationship between the decibel levels of Rip Tide and the 1998 siren.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4**
- The Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide. This helps us establish a sequence of increasing decibels among these sirens.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm. This clue helps us further extend the sequence of decibel levels.

**Step 4: Establish a decibel sequence**
- From Clues 3, 4, and 5, we can establish a decibel relationship:
  - If Rip Tide is X decibels, then Soundarm is X + 5 decibels, and Bradley X9 is X + 15 decibels.
  - Since Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the 1998 siren, if Rip Tide is X, the 1998 siren is X + 10 decibels.

**Step 5: Determine possible values**
- Given the decibel options (100, 105, 110, 115), and knowing the sequence, we can assign:
  - Rip Tide = 100 decibels
  - Soundarm = 105 decibels
  - 1998 siren = 110 decibels
  - Bradley X9 = 115 decibels

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 1**
- The siren with 105 decibels is either the siren released in 2009 or the Bradley X9. Since Bradley X9 is 115 decibels, the 105 decibels siren released in 2009 must be the Soundarm.

**Step 7: Analyze Clue 2**
- The siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009. Since the 2009 siren (Soundarm) is 105 decibels, the 1999 siren must be Rip Tide with 100 decibels.

**Step 8: Assign remaining years**
- With Rip Tide in 1999 and Soundarm in 2009, Bradley X9 in 1998, the only remaining year for the remaining siren (Securalert) is 2007.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
```
100 decibels | Rip Tide    | 1999
105 decibels | Soundarm    | 2009
110 decibels | Securalert  | 2007

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998. This establishes a direct relationship between the decibel levels of Rip Tide and the 1998 siren.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4**
- The Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide. This helps us establish a sequence of increasing decibels among these sirens.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm. This clue helps us further extend the sequence of decibel levels.

**Step 4: Establish a decibel sequence**
- From Clues 3, 4, and 5, we can establish a decibel relationship:
  - If Rip Tide is X decibels, then Soundarm is X + 5 decibels, and Bradley X9 is X + 15 decibels.
  - Since Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the 1998 siren, if Rip Tide is X, the 1998 siren is X + 10 decibels.

**Step 5: Determine possible values**
- Given the decibel options (100, 105, 110, 115), and knowing the sequence, we can assign:
  - Rip Tide = 100 decibels
  - Soundarm = 105 decibels
  - 1998 siren = 110 decibels
  - Bradley X9 = 115 decibels

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 1**
- The siren with 105 decibels is either the siren released in 2009 or the Bradley X9. Since Bradley X9 is 115 decibels, the 105 decibels siren released in 2009 must be the Soundarm.

**Step 7: Analyze Clue 2**
- The siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009. Since the 2009 siren (Soundarm) is 105 decibels, the 1999 siren must be Rip Tide with 100 decibels.

**Step 8: Assign remaining years**
- With Rip Tide in 1999 and Soundarm in 2009, Bradley X9 in 1998, the only remaining year for the remaining siren (Securalert) is 2007.

3. From clue 3, Underwood discovered a comet in 2010 (2 years after 2008).
4. From clue 4, Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. Since we don't know Hal's year yet, we'll keep this in mind.
5. From clue 5, the comet discovered in 2010 is either the one Ken Jones discovered or Crecci. Since Underwood discovered a comet in 2010, Ken Jones did not discover in 2010. Therefore, the comet in 2010 must be Crecci.

- 2008 | Jack Ingram | ?
- 2009 | ? | Casputi
- 2010 | Underwood | Crecci
- 2011 | ? | ?

Continuing from the clues:
- Since Underwood discovered in 2010 and it's Crecci, Ken Jones must discover in a different year. 
- Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. Since Hal cannot be in 2009 (as Casputi was discovered by someone else), and 2010 is taken by Underwood, Hal must be in 2011, and Peinope in 2010. But since 2010 is taken by Crecci, Hal must be in 2011, and Peinope in 2009. This contradicts our earlier assignment, so we need to adjust: Hal is in 2011, and Peinope in 2010, meaning Underwood discovered Peinope, not Crecci.
- Ken Jones then must be in 2009, discovering Casputi.

2009 | Ken Jones | Casputi
2010 | Underwood | Peinope
2011 | Hal Gregory | Crecci","1. From clue 1, we know that the comet discovered in 2009 is Casputi.
2. From clue 2, Jack Ingram discovered a comet in 2008.
3. From clue 3, Underwood discovered a comet in 2010 (2 years after 2008).
4. From clue 4, Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. Since we don't know Hal's year yet, we'll keep this in mind.
5. From clue 5, the comet discovered in 2010 is either the one Ken Jones discovered or Crecci. Since Underwood discovered a comet in 2010, Ken Jones did not discover in 2010. Therefore, the comet in 2010 must be Crecci.
6. Now, let's fill in the information we have:
   - 2008 | Jack Ingram | ?
   - 2009 | ? | Casputi
   - 2010 | Underwood | Crecci
   - 2011 | ? | ?
7. Continuing from the clues:
   - Since Underwood discovered in 2010 and it's Crecci, Ken Jones must discover in a different year.
   - Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. Since Hal cannot be in 2009 (as Casputi was discovered by someone else), and 2010 is taken by Underwood, Hal must be in 2011, and Peinope in 2010. But since 2010 is taken by Crecci, Hal must be in 2011, and Peinope in 2009. This contradicts our earlier assignment, so we need to adjust: Hal is in 2011, and Peinope in 2010, meaning Underwood discovered Peinope, not Crecci.
   - Ken Jones then must be in 2009, discovering Casputi.
8. Finalizing:
   - 2008 | Jack Ingram | Sporrin (the only comet left)
   - 2009 | Ken Jones | Casputi
   - 2010 | Underwood | Peinope

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Clue 1:** The Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people were all different cultures.
- This implies Oiracha is neither founded in 850 AD nor has a population of 4,500.

**Clue 2:** The culture with 9,500 people was founded sometime before the culture with 4,500 people.
- This establishes a chronological order between these two populations.

**Clue 3:** Of the culture with 4,500 people and the culture with 9,500 people, one was the Budel culture and the other was founded in 600 AD.
- This links Budel either to 4,500 or 9,500 people, and either 4,500 or 9,500 people to the year 600 AD.

**Clue 4:** The culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people.
- This helps us calculate the founding years relative to each other for these populations.

**Clue 5:** The Sameos culture was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people.
- This also helps establish a relative timeline between Sameos and the 7,500 population culture.

### Deductions:
- From Clue 4, if the culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the one with 9,500 people, and considering the available years, if 9,500 is linked to 600 AD (from Clue 3), then 5,000 must be linked to 350 AD.
- From Clue 5, if Sameos was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people, and 7,500 cannot be 600 AD (as it's taken by 9,500 from Clue 3 and 4), then Sameos must be 100 AD and 7,500 must be 350 AD.
- From Clue 1, since Oiracha is not 850 AD and not 4,500, and since 850 AD is different from 4,500, we can deduce that 850 AD is linked to another culture and population.
- From Clue 3, if Budel is either 4,500 or 9,500 and one of these is 600 AD, and since 9,500 is linked to 600 AD, Budel must be 4,500 and founded in a different year.

### Final Answer:
- **100 AD | Sameos | 7,500**
- **350 AD | Hatgare | 5,000** (since Oiracha and Sameos are placed, and Budel is 4,500)
- **600 AD | Budel | 9,500**

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Clue 3**
- 2009 is the year Casputi was discovered.

**Step 2: Clue 1**
- Wally Six is either the comet Tillman discovered or the comet discovered in 2009.
- Since 2009 is already assigned to Casputi, Tillman must have discovered Wally Six.

**Step 3: Clue 4**
- Of the comet discovered in 2010 and the one discovered in 2008, one is Wally Six and the other was first seen by Jack Ingram.
- Since Tillman discovered Wally Six, Wally Six cannot be the comet discovered in 2010 (as it would conflict with the astronomer).
- Therefore, Wally Six was discovered in 2008, and the comet discovered in 2010 was first seen by Jack Ingram.

**Step 4: Clue 2**
- Of Trosny and Casputi, one was found in 2008 and the other was first seen by Hal Gregory.
- Since 2008 is already assigned to Wally Six, Hal Gregory must have discovered Casputi in 2009.

**Step 5: Remaining Assignments**
- The remaining comet for 2010, seen by Jack Ingram, must be Klionne (as Trosny and Casputi are already assigned, and Wally Six was discovered in 2008).
- The remaining year, 2011, must then be assigned to the remaining astronomer, Ken Jones, and the remaining comet, which is Trosny.

"Step-by-step solution:
- From clue 5, we know that Lyle Lucas started in 2007. So, we can fill in:
  2007 | ? | Lyle Lucas

- From clue 3, we know that ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino. We will use this information as we proceed.

- From clue 4, either ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) or Peter Powers started in 2009 and the other in 2010. Since ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino, we can fill in:
  2009 | ? | ?
  2010 | ? | ?

- From clue 2, the hero who started in 2009 is either ""Criminal Bane"" or Peter Powers. Since we know from clue 4 that either ""Ultra Hex"" or Peter Powers started in 2009, and ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino, it must be Peter Powers who started in 2009. Thus:
  2009 | ? | Peter Powers

- Since Peter Powers started in 2009, ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) must have started in 2010:
  2010 | Ultra Hex | Tim Trevino

- From clue 1, ""Green Avenger"" began 1 year before Peter Powers. Since Peter Powers began in 2009, ""Green Avenger"" began in 2008:
  2008 | Green Avenger | ?

- Now, we know the remaining superhero in 2009 must be ""Criminal Bane"" since Peter Powers is the real name already assigned to 2009:
  2009 | Criminal Bane | Peter Powers

- The remaining year, 2007, must be assigned to the remaining superhero, which is ""Max Fusion"":
  2007 | Max Fusion | Lyle Lucas

- The remaining real name for 2008, where ""Green Avenger"" is the superhero, must be Hal Houston, as Tim Trevino and Peter Powers are already assigned, and Lyle Lucas started in 2007:

Final Answer:
2007 | Max Fusion | Lyle Lucas

"Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 2, we know Grosmolen was built in 1729.
2. From Clue 3, we know Vlietmolen was built in 1706.
3. From Clue 1, since Grosmolen was built in 1729 and is one of the windmills mentioned in the clue, the other windmill built in 1683 must be Doesmolen. Also, one of these (Doesmolen or Grosmolen) is owned by the De Vries family.
4. Since Grosmolen is already assigned to 1729, Doesmolen must be assigned to 1683.
5. From Clue 4, the Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill. Since we know Grosmolen (1729) is not associated with the Bakker family (as it would imply a year beyond the given options for the Meijer family's windmill), and Vlietmolen is in 1706, the Meijer family must be associated with Vlietmolen. This places the Bakker family's windmill in 1729 + 23 = 1752.
6. The remaining windmill for 1752 is Zemelmolen, which must be associated with the Bakker family.
7. Since the De Vries family is associated with either Doesmolen or Grosmolen, and Grosmolen is already in 1729, De Vries must be associated with Grosmolen.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Direct Clues**
- Clue 2 states that Nick went first. We can place Nick in the first order.

**Step 2: Logical Deduction**
- Clue 1 states that the person who went third was either Nick or the juggler who used flashlights. Since Nick went first, the person who went third must have used flashlights.
- Clue 3 states that the performer who used batons performed 1 spot after the person who used flashlights. Since flashlights were used third, batons must be used fourth.
- Clue 4 states that of Nick and Carmen, one went second and the other used balls. Since Nick went first, Carmen cannot be second, so Carmen must have used balls. Since Nick cannot be second, the second performer must be the other option, which we will determine.
- Clue 5 states that the performer who used flashlights was either Lora or Carmen. Since Carmen used balls, Lora must have used flashlights and performed third.

**Step 3: Process of Elimination**
- Since Nick went first and used balls (from Clue 4), Carmen cannot be second. We know Lora is third with flashlights, and the fourth performer used batons. The remaining name for the second performer is Wesley.
- The remaining item for Wesley (second performer) must be bowling pins, as all other items are accounted for.

**Step 4: Verification**
- Check all clues are satisfied:
  - Clue 1: Third performer used flashlights (Lora, correct).
  - Clue 2: Nick went first (correct).
  - Clue 3: Batons follow flashlights (fourth after third, correct).
  - Clue 4: Carmen used balls, and Nick did not go second (correct).
  - Clue 5: Lora used flashlights (correct).

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

| Order  | Name   | Item         |

| first  | Nick   | balls        |

- Since Nick went first and used balls (from Clue 4), Carmen cannot be second. We know Lora is third with flashlights, and the fourth performer used batons. The remaining name for the second performer is Wesley.
- The remaining item for Wesley (second performer) must be bowling pins, as all other items are accounted for.

**Step 4: Verification**
- Check all clues are satisfied:
  - Clue 1: Third performer used flashlights (Lora, correct).
  - Clue 2: Nick went first (correct).
  - Clue 3: Batons follow flashlights (fourth after third, correct).
  - Clue 4: Carmen used balls, and Nick did not go second (correct).
  - Clue 5: Lora used flashlights (correct).

This arrangement satisfies all the clues and fills the grid correctly.","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Direct Clues**
- Clue 2 states that Nick went first. We can place Nick in the first order.

**Step 2: Logical Deduction**
- Clue 1 states that the person who went third was either Nick or the juggler who used flashlights. Since Nick went first, the person who went third must have used flashlights.

**Step 3: Logical Deduction**
- Clue 3 states that the performer who used batons performed 1 spot after the person who used flashlights. Since flashlights were used third, batons must be used fourth.

**Step 4: Logical Deduction**
- Clue 4 states that of Nick and Carmen, one went second and the other used balls. Since Nick went first, Carmen cannot be second, so Carmen must have used balls. Since Nick cannot be second, the second performer must be the other option, which we will determine.

**Step 5: Logical Deduction**
- Clue 5 states that the performer who used flashlights was either Lora or Carmen. Since Carmen used balls, Lora must have used flashlights and performed third.

**Step 6: Process of Elimination**
- Since Nick went first and used balls (from Clue 4), Carmen cannot be second. We know Lora is third with flashlights, and the fourth performer used batons. The remaining name for the second performer is Wesley.

"Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 4 (Fushil was discovered sometime before Teuz), we establish the order of discovery between Fushil and Teuz.
2. From Clue 2 (Of the island on which the Holo'oka people lived and the island discovered in 1761, one was Fushil and the other was Teuz), we know that either Fushil or Teuz was discovered in 1761, and one of them is where Holo'oka lived.
3. From Clue 1 (The island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Jujihm or Teuz), we can deduce that Holo'oka lived on Teuz since Fushil was discovered before Teuz (from Clue 4) and one of Fushil or Teuz was discovered in 1761.
4. Since Teuz is where Holo'oka lived, and it was either discovered in 1761 or later, and Fushil was discovered before Teuz, Fushil must be the island discovered in 1761.
5. From Clue 5 (The island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm), we can calculate the years once we place Jujihm.
6. From Clue 3 (The island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived), we know the relative order of discovery between Hakili and Manika'i.

Let's apply these clues:
- Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and before Teuz, and Holo'oka lived on Teuz, Teuz cannot be 1761. Therefore, Teuz must be discovered after 1761.
- If we place Jujihm in 1775, then Hakili, which was discovered 7 years before Jujihm, would be in 1768.
- Since Hakili was discovered after Manika'i (Clue 3), Manika'i must be in 1754.
- The remaining island, Zafet, and the remaining culture, Kukani, must then be placed in the remaining year, 1775.

Final Answer:
1754 | Manika'i | Fushil

"Step-by-step solution:
- Analyzing Clue 3, the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's computer. This establishes a relationship between the size of Victor's hard drive and the computer with 1 GB of RAM.
- From Clue 4, the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM. This helps us link the hard drive sizes of these two RAM capacities.
- Clue 5 states that the computer with 256 GB of hard drive space is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM. This clue helps narrow down the possibilities for the 256 GB hard drive.

Let's start filling in the grid:
- If the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive 256 GB smaller than Victor's, and the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM, then:
  - If the 1 GB RAM computer has 128 GB, then the 4 GB RAM computer must have 384 GB. This leaves Victor with either 256 GB or 512 GB.

- From Clue 2, the computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive smaller than Alejandro's. This means Alejandro cannot have the smallest hard drive.
- From Clue 1, Jack's computer is either the system with 256 GB of hard drive space or the build with 4 GB of RAM. Since we know the 4 GB RAM computer has 384 GB, Jack cannot have 256 GB if he has 4 GB of RAM.

Assigning based on deductions:
- If Jack has 4 GB of RAM and 384 GB hard drive, then from Clue 1, this is confirmed.
- If the 1 GB RAM computer has 128 GB, then Victor must have 384 GB or 512 GB. Since 384 GB is taken by Jack, Victor must have 512 GB.
- This leaves Otis with the 256 GB hard drive, and from Clue 5, Otis cannot have 12 GB of RAM, so he must have 3 GB of RAM.
- Alejandro then has the remaining 12 GB of RAM and the only remaining hard drive size, which is 256 GB.

Final Answer:
128 GB | Otis | 1 GB
256 GB | Alejandro | 12 GB
384 GB | Jack | 4 GB
512 GB | Victor | 3 GB

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Identify Direct Clues**
- From clue 1: Harry is the musician.

**Step 2: Sequential Clues**
- From clue 2: Dale has a birthday 1 month after Harry.
- From clue 3: Adrian has a birthday 1 month after the surgeon.
- From clue 4: The architect has a birthday 2 months after the surgeon.

**Step 3: Assigning Dates**
- Since Harry is the musician, and Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's, we need to find a date that allows another date exactly one month later. The possible dates for Harry are April 13th or May 18th, as June 14th would not allow a month later within the given dates.
- If Harry is on April 13th, Dale would be on May 18th. If Harry is on May 18th, Dale would be on June 14th.

**Step 4: Further Deductions**
- If Harry is on April 13th and Dale on May 18th, then:
  - The surgeon cannot be on April 13th or May 18th because Adrian (not the surgeon) needs a date 1 month after the surgeon, and the architect is 2 months after the surgeon.
  - If the surgeon is on June 14th, Adrian would be on July 16th, and the architect would not fit any remaining date.
  - Therefore, Harry cannot be on April 13th.

- If Harry is on May 18th and Dale on June 14th:
  - The surgeon could be on April 13th, Adrian would then be on May 18th, but Adrian cannot be on the same day as Harry.
  - Therefore, the surgeon must be on another date.

- If the surgeon is on July 16th:
  - Adrian would be on a non-existent August date, which is impossible.

- Therefore, the surgeon must be on June 14th:
  - Adrian is then on July 16th.
  - The architect, being 2 months after the surgeon, would be on a non-existent August date, which is impossible.

- Re-evaluating, if the surgeon is on May 18th:
  - Adrian would be on June 14th.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Clue 1:** The alligator that is 14.0 feet long is either the 20-year-old alligator or Arthur.
- This clue restricts the 14.0 feet long alligator to either being 20 years old or named Arthur.

**Clue 2:** The animal that is 11.5 feet long is somewhat younger than Arthur.
- Arthur cannot be the youngest (5 years old), so Arthur must be at least 10 years old.

**Clue 3:** Of the animal that is 12.0 feet long and Carlos, one is 20 years old and the other is 10 years old.
- This sets specific age possibilities for Carlos and the 12.0 feet long alligator.

**Clue 4:** The alligator that is 11.5 feet long is 5 years younger than Carlos.
- This helps us determine Carlos's age relative to the 11.5 feet long alligator.

**Clue 5:** Iggy is 10 years younger than the animal that is 14.0 feet long.
- This helps determine Iggy's age relative to the 14.0 feet long alligator.

**Using the clues:**
- From Clue 1 and Clue 5, if the 14.0 feet long alligator is 20 years old, then Iggy must be 10 years old.
- From Clue 3, if Iggy is 10 years old, he cannot be Carlos. Therefore, Carlos must be 20 years old and the 12.0 feet long alligator is 10 years old.
- From Clue 4, if Carlos is 20 years old, the 11.5 feet long alligator must be 15 years old (5 years younger than Carlos).
- From Clue 2, since the 11.5 feet long alligator is 15 years old and younger than Arthur, Arthur cannot be 15 years old or younger. Arthur must be the 14.0 feet long alligator and 20 years old.
- This leaves Sparky as the remaining name for the 12.0 feet long, 10-year-old alligator.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Assign known facts from clues**
- From Clue 1: The letter sent in 1962 was from Torquay.
- From Clue 2: George's message was sent in 1969.

**Step 2: Analyze and apply additional clues**
- From Clue 3: Between the letter from Brighton and the one sent in 1976, one is George's and the other is Karla's. Since George's message was sent in 1969, Karla's message must be the one sent in 1976. Consequently, the letter from Brighton must be George's, which was sent in 1969.

**Step 3: Use process of elimination for remaining options**
- From Clue 4: Tracy's message, the bottle sent in 1983, and the message from Penzance are all different letters. Since 1969 is George's from Brighton and 1976 is Karla's, Tracy cannot be associated with 1969 or 1976. Also, 1983 cannot be from Penzance.
- Since 1962 is from Torquay and 1969 is from Brighton, the remaining origins for 1976 and 1983 are Penzance and Le Havre. Since 1983 cannot be Penzance (Clue 4), it must be Le Havre. Therefore, 1976 is from Penzance.
- The remaining writer for 1983 is Tracy (as deduced from Clue 4 and previous eliminations).
- The only remaining year and writer for 1962 is Sean (since George is 1969, Karla is 1976, and Tracy is 1983).

- Since Dustin is at Casa Loma and Janice is at Greektown, the remaining guide for 7:00am at High Park is either Faye or Kelly. Since Faye is at 8:00am, Kelly must be at 10:00am, and the remaining guide for 7:00am is the one not yet assigned, which is not Faye or Kelly, leaving Dustin. However, Dustin is already assigned to Casa Loma, so the guide at 7:00am must be the remaining one, which is not Faye or Kelly, leaving the only option as Dustin.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet.
  - This establishes a direct sequence between Alberta and Gladys.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
  - Since Gladys is directly linked to Alberta by Clue 4, and one of them must be in January or February, we can start positioning them.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
  - This helps us place Ellen relative to the macaw.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 5**
- The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird.
  - This clue helps us order the purchase of these two birds.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 3**
- The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.
  - This further helps in sequencing the birds.

**Step 6: Deduction and Placement**
- From Clue 4 and Clue 1, if Alberta's pet is bought 1 month before Gladys's, and Gladys's pet is one of the birds in January or February, Alberta must be in January and Gladys in February.
- Since the macaw is one of the birds in January or February (Clue 1), and it cannot be Alberta's (as Alberta's is 1 month before Gladys's), the macaw must be Gladys's pet in February.
- From Clue 2, since the macaw is in February, Ellen's pet must be in April (2 months later).
- From Clue 5 and Clue 3, the lovebird must be before the finch, and the finch must be before the parakeet. Since Ellen's pet is in April and it's 2 months after the macaw, Ellen's pet cannot be the finch or lovebird. Thus, Ellen's pet is the parakeet.
- The only month left for the finch is March, and the only bird left for January is the lovebird.
- The only names left for March and January are Della and Alberta, respectively. Since Alberta is in January (from earlier deduction), Della must be in March.

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Heights**
- From clue 4, Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall.

**Step 2: Use Direct Clues**
- Clue 1 states that the Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94-year-old tree. This means the Marsh Tree cannot be the shortest tree (144 ft.) since there would be no height 3 feet shorter for the 94-year-old tree. We will find the height of the 94-year-old tree first.

**Step 3: Deduce Relationships**
- Clue 2 states that of The Senator and Marsh Tree, one is 85 years old and the other is 153 ft. tall. Since we don't know yet which is which, we'll keep this in mind.
- Clue 3 states that The Senator is taller than the 96-year-old tree. This means The Senator cannot be the shortest tree.

Given that Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. and not involved in clues 2 or 3, we can start eliminating:
- If The Senator is taller than the 96-year-old tree, and considering clue 2, The Senator cannot be 144 ft. or 147 ft. (Zeke's Spruce). The Senator must be 153 ft. tall, leaving Marsh Tree to be 85 years old.

- Since Marsh Tree is 85 years old and not 94 years old, the 94-year-old tree must be shorter than Marsh Tree. The only options left for the 94-year-old tree are 144 ft. or 150 ft. Since Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94-year-old tree (clue 1), the 94-year-old tree must be 150 ft., making Marsh Tree 153 ft. tall.

- This leaves Evan's Fir to be the remaining tree, which must be 144 ft. tall and 96 years old (since The Senator is taller than the 96-year-old tree and is 153 ft. tall).

**Step 4: Verify Consistency**
- Check all clues are satisfied with this arrangement:
  - Clue 1: Marsh Tree (153 ft.) is 3 feet taller than the 94-year-old tree (150 ft.) - Correct.
  - Clue 2: Marsh Tree is 85 years old, and The Senator is 153 ft. tall - Correct.

"Step-by-step solution:
- From Clue 1: The camera made by Banion costs $25 more than the DM-5000. This means the DM-5000 cannot be the most expensive camera ($625) since there must be a price that is $25 more than it.
- From Clue 2: One of the cameras made by Honwa or Banion is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550. Since Banion's camera costs $25 more than the DM-5000, if DM-5000 is not the cheapest, it could be $575, making Banion's camera $600. But we need to verify this with other clues.
- From Clue 3: The FC-520 costs $50 more than the camera made by Cober. This sets a relationship that needs to be matched with available prices.

Let's assign prices:
- If DM-5000 is $575 (as it can't be the cheapest or the most expensive), then Banion's camera (which is $25 more) would be $600.
- If Banion's camera is $600, and either Banion or Honwa's camera is $550 or Tela G5, then Honwa's camera must be $550 or Tela G5. Since Banion's camera is $600, it can't be $550, so Honwa's camera is $550.
- Since Honwa's camera is $550, it can't be Tela G5 (as Banion's camera is $600 and not Tela G5), so Honwa's camera must be another model. If Banion's camera is not Tela G5, it must be another model, leaving Tela G5 to be priced differently.
- Since FC-520 is $50 more than Cober's camera, and Cober's camera can't be $575 (as DM-5000 is $575), if Cober's camera is $550, then FC-520 would be $600, which conflicts with Banion's camera. So, Cober's camera must be $575, making FC-520 $625.

"Step-by-step solution:
- From Clue 4, we know that Lirios makes the Lectra 6.
- Clue 1 states that the camera made by Lirios costs $25 more than the model made by Torvia. Since Lirios makes the Lectra 6, the price of Lectra 6 is $25 more than Torvia's camera.
- Clue 3 tells us that one of Torvia or Nectron's cameras is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550. Since the price difference between Lirios (Lectra 6) and Torvia is $25, and the prices are $550, $575, $600, $625, Torvia's camera cannot be $625 (as it would make Lirios's camera $650, which is not an option). If Torvia's camera is $550, then Lirios's camera (Lectra 6) must be $575.
- Since Torvia's camera is not $625, and the Tela G5 costs $25 more than the Zenix 2C (Clue 5), the only way to maintain this relationship is if the Zenix 2C costs $550 and the Tela G5 costs $575. But since we already determined that Lirios's Lectra 6 costs $575, Tela G5 must cost $600 and Zenix 2C $575.
- This means Torvia's camera cannot be $550 (as it would make it the Zenix 2C, but we know it costs $575). Therefore, Nectron's camera must be $550, and Torvia's camera (Tela G5) is $600.
- The remaining camera, DM-5000, which is not yet assigned, must be made by Dayero and cost $625.

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Identify Direct Clues**
- Clue 3 directly states that Elsie's canine won in 2008.

**Step 2: Use Process of Elimination**
- From Clue 5, the beagle won 2 years before the pekingese. Since the beagle must have won 2 years before the pekingese, the only years that fit this description are 2006 for the beagle and 2008 for the pekingese. However, since Elsie's dog won in 2008 and it's a different dog from the beagle (Clue 1), the beagle must have won in 2007 and the pekingese in 2009.

**Step 3: Cross-Reference Clues**
- Clue 2 states Chester's canine is either the canine that won in 2006 or the beagle. Since the beagle won in 2007, Chester's dog must be the one from 2006.
- Clue 4 states that of the canine that won in 2009 and the dog that won in 2006, one is the pekingese and the other is Fernando's. Since the pekingese won in 2009, Fernando's dog must be the one from 2006.

**Step 4: Confirm Remaining Options**
- Since Fernando's dog is from 2006 and Chester's dog is also from 2006, and Fernando's dog is not the beagle (as the beagle won in 2007), Fernando's dog must be the maltese (from Clue 1, the beagle, maltese, and 2006 winner are all different dogs).

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Of the sighting at Laurel Grove and Francis's account, one happened in March and the other in May.
- This means Laurel Grove and Francis are either in March or May, but not in the same month.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- The March account and the sighting at Laurel Grove were different events.
- Since Laurel Grove cannot be in March, it must be in May. Therefore, Francis's account is in March.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- The sighting at Seryl Forest was either Wanda's event or the June event.
- Since no other information contradicts this, we keep both possibilities open for now.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Hannah's event took place 2 months after the account at Seryl Forest.
- If Seryl Forest is in June, Hannah's event would be in August, which is not listed. Therefore, Seryl Forest cannot be in June. It must be in April, placing Hannah's event in June.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- The account at Juniper Springs was either the April sighting or Hannah's sighting.
- Since Hannah's event is in June, Juniper Springs cannot be Hannah's sighting. Therefore, Juniper Springs is the April sighting.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Options**
- With Francis in March, Laurel Grove in May, Seryl Forest in April, and Hannah in June, the remaining witness for May is Jenny.
- The remaining location for March is Bald Hill Run, and since Seryl Forest is in April, Wanda, linked to Seryl Forest, must be the witness in April.

   - From Clue 1, the baby born at 12:07am is the Underwoods' baby. Therefore, Maxine, the Blanchards' baby, and the child born at 12:10am are the remaining options for the other times.

4. **Clue 4: Of the Ortegas' child and the baby born at 12:10am, one was Luis and the other was Susan.**
   - Since the Ortegas' baby could be Susan or the child born at 12:04am, and one of the Ortegas' child or the baby born at 12:10am is Susan or Luis, we can deduce that if the Ortegas' baby is Susan, then the baby born at 12:10am is Luis, and vice versa.

5. **Given the above deductions:**
   - Peggy at 12:01am, Underwoods at 12:07am.
   - Ortegas' baby is either Susan or at 12:04am.
   - Maxine and Blanchards' baby are at 12:04am or 12:10am.
   - Luis or Susan is at 12:10am.

6. **Since Peggy is at 12:01am, and the Underwoods' baby is at 12:07am, and the Ortegas' baby is either Susan or at 12:04am, we can deduce:**
   - Ortegas' baby is Susan at 12:04am.
   - Luis is the baby at 12:10am.
   - Maxine is the Blanchards' baby at 12:07am.

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Apply Direct Clues and Process of Elimination**
- Clue 5 states that Fushil was either discovered in 1768 or 1754. We'll keep this in mind as we proceed.

**Step 2: Use Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk. This means if we place Nuhirk in a year, Verinya must be exactly 7 years earlier. The only possible years that fit this 7-year gap are 1768 for Nuhirk and 1761 for Verinya.

**Step 3: Apply Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that of the island on which the Kukani people lived and the island on which the Wainani people lived, one was discovered in 1761 and the other was Nuhirk. Since Nuhirk is in 1768, the island discovered in 1761 must be where the Kukani or Wainani people lived. Since Verinya is in 1761, it must be one of these cultures.

**Step 4: Use Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that Zafet was either the island on which the Kukani people lived or the island on which the Manika'i people lived. Since Verinya is already assigned to either Kukani or Wainani, Zafet must be the other option between Kukani or Manika'i.

**Step 5: Apply Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that the island on which the Enakai people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived. Since Zafet is either Kukani or Manika'i, and Verinya is either Kukani or Wainani, and Nuhirk is not associated with these clues directly, Enakai must be on Fushil, and it must be in 1775 (the only year left after placing other islands).

**Step 6: Finalize the Grid**
- Since Fushil is either 1768 or 1754 and Enakai is in 1775, Fushil must be in 1754. This leaves 1768 for Nuhirk.
- Verinya in 1761 must be associated with Wainani (since Zafet is either Kukani or Manika'i and Nuhirk is not associated with these cultures).
- Zafet, therefore, must be associated with Kukani in 1775.

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Clues**
We have four months, four games, and four developers. Each month will have one unique game and one unique developer associated with it.

**Step 2: Initial Deductions**
- Clue 3 states that Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka. This means Angry Ants cannot be in June and Peter Parka cannot be in March.

**Step 3: Cross-Referencing**
- Clue 2 states that Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic. This means Wizard World cannot be in March and Apptastic's game cannot be in June.

**Step 4: Process of Elimination**
- Clue 1 states that Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez, and the game released in May are all different apps. This means that if one of these is assigned to a month, the other two cannot be in the same month.
- Clue 4 states that of Peter Parka and the application released in May, one was made by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo. This means neither can be associated with BeGamez or Vortia.

**Step 5: Further Deductions**
- Since Angry Ants is released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka, and considering the constraints from Clue 4, if Peter Parka is in May (and thus could be developed by Apptastic or Gadingo), Angry Ants must be in April.
- From Clue 2, if Wizard World is released 1 month later than Apptastic's game, and considering Peter Parka could be Apptastic's game in May, Wizard World would then be in June.

**Step 6: Final Assignments**
- With Angry Ants in April and not developed by Apptastic (as it's not Peter Parka), and Wizard World in June, developed by someone other than Apptastic or Gadingo (from Clue 4), we can deduce:
  - March: Vitalinks by BeGamez (since it's different from the May game and developer, and BeGamez isn't mentioned with other months).
  - April: Angry Ants by Vortia (since BeGamez is taken by Vitalinks and Gadingo and Apptastic are for May).
  - May: Peter Parka by Apptastic (from Clue 4).

- This means Charlie cannot be at 11:00am and India cannot be at 8:00am.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Charlie Group is either at 8:00am or at Ezra Forest.
- Since Charlie cannot be at 11:00am, if Charlie is not at 8:00am, then Charlie must be at Ezra Forest.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the squad at Anthon Ridge and the team at 10:00am, one is Foxtrot Group and the other is India Group.
- Since India cannot be at 8:00am, India could be at 10:00am or at Anthon Ridge.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the team at 9:00am and the team at 10:00am, one is India Group and the other is at Crestline X.
- If India is at 10:00am, then the team at 9:00am must be at Crestline X.

**Step 5: Deductions from Steps 1-4**
- If Charlie is at 8:00am, then India must be at 10:00am (from Clue 4).
- If India is at 10:00am, then 9:00am is Crestline X (from Clue 3).
- If 9:00am is Crestline X, then Foxtrot cannot be at 10:00am (from Clue 2), so Foxtrot must be at Anthon Ridge.
- This leaves Whiskey Group for the remaining slot.

**Step 6: Fill in the remaining details**
- Charlie at 8:00am means Charlie cannot be at Ezra Forest, so Charlie must be at another location.
- Since Foxtrot is at Anthon Ridge, and Crestline X is at 9:00am, the remaining locations for Charlie are Frazier Park or Ezra Forest.

- Charlie at 8:00am means Charlie cannot be at Ezra Forest, so Charlie must be at another location.
- Since Foxtrot is at Anthon Ridge, and Crestline X is at 9:00am, the remaining locations for Charlie are Frazier Park or Ezra Forest.
- Since Charlie is either at 8:00am or Ezra Forest, Charlie must be at Ezra Forest at 8:00am.
- Whiskey Group must be at 11:00am at Frazier Park.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer:
- 8:00am | Charlie | Ezra Forest
- 9:00am | India | Crestline X
- 10:00am | Foxtrot | Anthon Ridge

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Wendell Orr was either the sailor who finished in 270 days or the person in the gaff cutter.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop, one finished in 270 days and the other finished in 278 days.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Tara Carroll took 4 more days to finish than Ed Alexander.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days to finish than Ed Alexander.

**Step 5: Deductions and Logical Reasoning**
- Since Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed Alexander, and the days are 270, 274, 278, and 282, Tara and Ed must be associated with consecutive time slots that differ by 4 days.
- From Clue 4, the pilot cutter also must be associated with a time slot 4 days before one of Ed's possible slots.

**Step 6: Further Deductions**
- If Wendell Orr was in the gaff cutter or finished in 270 days, and considering the pilot cutter finishes 4 days before Ed, Wendell cannot be in the pilot cutter.
- Since Vicky Estes and the sloop competitor are either 270 or 278, and Wendell Orr is either 270 or in the gaff cutter, if Wendell is not in the sloop, then Vicky Estes cannot be in 278 if she is not in the sloop.

**Step 7: Placing Sailors and Boats**
- If Wendell Orr is in 270 days, he cannot be in the sloop (as it must be either 270 or 278). Thus, he must be in the gaff cutter.
- If Wendell is in the gaff cutter at 270, then the sloop must be at 278.
- Ed Alexander cannot be at 278 (as he would be in the sloop), so he must be at 274 or 282. Since Tara Carroll takes 4 more days, she must be at 278 or 282. Since 278 is taken by the sloop, Ed must be at 274 and Tara at 282.
- The pilot cutter, taking 4 fewer days than Ed, must be at 270.

**Step 8: Final Placement**
- Wendell Orr is in the gaff cutter at 270.
- Ed Alexander is at 274, and the pilot cutter is at 270, so Vicky Estes must be at 278 in the sloop.
- Tara Carroll is at 282 in the remaining boat type, the schooner.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The ""Night Ninjas"" was ranked 1 place ahead of the ""Oil Crew"".
  This means if Night Ninjas are in any position, Oil Crew must be directly after them.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- The ""Target Bombs"" was ranked 1 place behind the orange team.
  This means if any team is orange, Target Bombs must be directly after them.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
- The ""Splat Squad"", the purple team, and the team that finished third are all different teams.
  This means Splat Squad cannot be third, cannot be purple, and the third team cannot be purple.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 3
- Of the ""Oil Crew"" and the group that finished third, one uses orange paintballs and the other uses red paintballs.
  Since they are different and one of them is third, we can start positioning them with colors.

Step 5: Deductions from Clues
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, if Night Ninjas are first, Oil Crew must be second. If Oil Crew is second and one of Oil Crew or third uses orange and the other uses red, and since Target Bombs follow the orange team, we can deduce:
  If Oil Crew is second and uses orange, Target Bombs must be third and use another color, but Clue 3 says third cannot be purple, so Target Bombs cannot be purple.
  If third is orange, then Target Bombs must be fourth.

Step 6: Further Deductions
- Since Splat Squad cannot be third or purple and cannot be the same as the third team, we can deduce:
  If Night Ninjas are first and not purple, and Oil Crew is second and orange, then Splat Squad can be fourth and not purple or third. If Target Bombs follow orange, they must be fourth if third is orange.

Step 7: Final Positioning
- Night Ninjas are first (not purple), Oil Crew is second and orange, Target Bombs are fourth, and Splat Squad is third (not purple). Since third cannot be purple, and Splat Squad is not purple, the only remaining color for Splat Squad is red. Therefore, Target Bombs must be purple.

"Let's correct the errors and solve the puzzle accurately:

Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 1, Darrell's drink costs 20 cents less than Charlie's drink. This means if Charlie's drink is $3.60, Darrell's drink would be $3.40. If Charlie's drink is $3.50, Darrell's drink would be $3.30, and so on.

2. From Clue 2, we know that either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink and one of them ordered the iced americano. This means the $3.60 drink and the iced americano are linked to Henry and Charlie.

3. From Clue 3, Jacob's drink costs 20 cents less than the espresso. This means Jacob's drink could be $3.30 if the espresso is $3.50, or $3.40 if the espresso is $3.60.

4. From Clue 4, the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink. This means the vanilla latte cannot be the cheapest drink.

Using these clues, let's deduce:
- If Charlie's drink is $3.60, then Darrell's drink is $3.40. Since the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink, it cannot be $3.30, so it must be either $3.50 or $3.60. But if the vanilla latte is $3.60, it contradicts the fact that either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink. Therefore, the vanilla latte must be $3.50.

- Since the vanilla latte is $3.50 and costs more than Darrell's drink ($3.40), and Jacob's drink costs 20 cents less than the espresso, the only price left for the espresso that fits is $3.60. Therefore, Jacob's drink, costing 20 cents less, is $3.40.

- This means Darrell's drink cannot be $3.40 as it would be the same as Jacob's. Therefore, Darrell's drink must be $3.30, and Charlie's drink is $3.60. Since Charlie's drink is $3.60, Henry must have ordered the iced americano.

- Since the vanilla latte is $3.50 and costs more than Darrell's drink ($3.40), and Jacob's drink costs 20 cents less than the espresso, the only price left for the espresso that fits is $3.60. Therefore, Jacob's drink, costing 20 cents less, is $3.40.

- This means Darrell's drink cannot be $3.40 as it would be the same as Jacob's. Therefore, Darrell's drink must be $3.30, and Charlie's drink is $3.60. Since Charlie's drink is $3.60, Henry must have ordered the iced americano.

- The remaining drink price for Darrell is $3.30, and the only drink left is the macchiato.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$3.30 | Darrell | macchiato
$3.40 | Jacob | espresso
$3.50 | Charlie | vanilla latte
$3.60 | Henry | iced americano

This solution fits all the clues without contradiction.","1. From Clue 1, Darrell's drink costs 20 cents less than Charlie's drink. This means if Charlie's drink is $3.60, Darrell's drink would be $3.40. If Charlie's drink is $3.50, Darrell's drink would be $3.30, and so on.

2. From Clue 2, we know that either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink and one of them ordered the iced americano. This means the $3.60 drink and the iced americano are linked to Henry and Charlie.

3. From Clue 3, Jacob's drink costs 20 cents less than the espresso. This means Jacob's drink could be $3.30 if the espresso is $3.50, or $3.40 if the espresso is $3.60.

4. From Clue 4, the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink. This means the vanilla latte cannot be the cheapest drink.

5. If Charlie's drink is $3.60, then Darrell's drink is $3.40. Since the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink, it cannot be $3.30, so it must be either $3.50 or $3.60. But if the vanilla latte is $3.60, it contradicts the fact that either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink. Therefore, the vanilla latte must be $3.50.

6. Since the vanilla latte is $3.50 and costs more than Darrell's drink ($3.40), and Jacob's drink costs 20 cents less than the espresso, the only price left for the espresso that fits is $3.60. Therefore, Jacob's drink, costing 20 cents less, is $3.40.

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clues**
- Clue 1: Amerigo made $6 million less than the movie directed by Hick Harmon.
- Clue 2: Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo.
- Clue 3: The movie directed by Micah Moreno made somewhat more than Tippecanoe.
- Clue 4: Of the movie directed by Nan Norman and Easy to Love, one made $11 million and the other made $2 million.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning**
- From Clue 4, we know that either the movie directed by Nan Norman or Easy to Love made $11 million, and the other made $2 million. We need more information to determine which is which.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can start to deduce the earnings of Amerigo and Zephyr Breeze. Since Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo, and the earnings options are $2 million, $5 million, $8 million, and $11 million, Amerigo cannot have made $8 million or $11 million because Zephyr Breeze would then exceed the available earnings options. If Amerigo made $2 million, Zephyr Breeze would have made $8 million.
- If Amerigo made $2 million and Zephyr Breeze made $8 million, then from Clue 1, the movie directed by Hick Harmon would have made $8 million (Amerigo + $6 million). This is not possible as Zephyr Breeze already has the $8 million slot. Therefore, Amerigo must make $5 million, and Zephyr Breeze makes $11 million. Consequently, Hick Harmon's movie must be $11 million.

**Step 3: Cross-Referencing**
- With Amerigo at $5 million and Zephyr Breeze at $11 million directed by Hick Harmon, we now know from Clue 4 that Easy to Love and the movie directed by Nan Norman are left with $2 million and $8 million. Since one of these must be $11 million and that slot is taken, Easy to Love must be $2 million and Nan Norman's movie must be $8 million.
- Clue 3 states that Micah Moreno's movie made somewhat more than Tippecanoe. Since the only remaining earnings higher than another is $8 million (Nan Norman's movie) over $5 million (Amerigo), Micah Moreno must direct the movie that made $8 million, and Tippecanoe must be the movie that made $5 million.

**Step 4: Fill the Table**

"Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 3, the team that reached 135 ft was either the Flying Eyes or used the hybrid sling. This means the Flying Eyes or the hybrid sling must be at 135 ft.

2. From Clue 5, the hybrid sling and the Russets were either at 180 ft or 135 ft. Since we know from Clue 3 that the hybrid sling could be at 135 ft, it's possible that the Russets are at 180 ft.

3. From Clue 1, the trebuchet was used by either the team that reached 150 ft or the Flying Eyes. Since we have the possibility of the Flying Eyes being at 135 ft, the trebuchet must be at 150 ft.

4. From Clue 2, the catapult landed 30 feet short of the slingshot. The only distances that fit this description are 150 ft for the catapult and 180 ft for the slingshot. Since we have already placed the trebuchet at 150 ft, the catapult must be at 135 ft, and the slingshot at 165 ft.

5. From Clue 4, the Spud Chuckers landed somewhat short of the Yukon Bolds. Since the only remaining distances are 150 ft and 165 ft, the Spud Chuckers must be at 150 ft and the Yukon Bolds at 165 ft.

6. Revisiting Clue 5 with the new information, since the Russets are at 180 ft and the hybrid sling is at 135 ft, the Flying Eyes must be at 135 ft using the hybrid sling.

Final Answer:
135 ft | Flying Eyes | hybrid sling
150 ft | Spud Chuckers | trebuchet
165 ft | Yukon Bolds | slingshot
180 ft | Russets | catapult

"### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person with 84 LinkedIn connections is either the person with 150 Facebook friends or Vickie.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the one with 150 Facebook friends and the one with 130 Facebook friends, one is Yvonne and the other has 84 LinkedIn connections.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we can deduce that the person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections. Therefore, Vickie cannot have 150 Facebook friends and must have a different number of Facebook friends.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari.
- Since we know the Facebook friend counts are 120, 130, 140, and 150, Danny and Kari must be one of these pairs: (140, 120) or (150, 130).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections.
- This means the pairs for Facebook friends with 57 and 70 LinkedIn connections could be (130, 120) or (140, 130).

**Step 5: Combine Clues**
- Since we know from Clue 3 that Yvonne is either 150 or 130 Facebook friends, and from Clue 1 and Clue 3 that 150 Facebook friends have 84 LinkedIn connections, Yvonne must be the one with 150 Facebook friends.
- Therefore, Vickie cannot have 150 Facebook friends and must have 130 Facebook friends with 64 LinkedIn connections (since 84 is taken by Yvonne and 57 and 70 are linked by Clue 4).

**Step 6: Finalize Danny and Kari**
- Since Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari, and Vickie has 130, Danny must have 150 and Kari 130. But since Vickie is already assigned 130, Danny must have 140 and Kari 120.

**Step 7: Assign LinkedIn connections**
- From Clue 4, the one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections. Since Danny has 140 Facebook friends, he must have 57 LinkedIn connections, and Kari with 120 Facebook friends must have 70 LinkedIn connections.

"**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The Friambliss was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir. This sets a relationship between the vintages of Friambliss and pinot noir.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- The 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein. This narrows down the options for the 1996 vintage.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Ece Suss is either the 1992 bottle or the 1996 wine. This gives two possible placements for Ece Suss.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the pinot gris and the 1984 wine, one is the Annata Branco and the other is the Friambliss. This clue helps to determine the type of wine for the 1984 vintage and pinot gris.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Zifennwein was bottled 4 years after the pinot gris. This establishes a timeline between Zifennwein and pinot gris.

**Step 6: Deductions and Logical Connections**
- From Clue 5 and Clue 2, if Zifennwein is 1996, then pinot gris must be 1992.
- From Clue 1, if Friambliss is 4 years before pinot noir, and pinot gris is not pinot noir, then pinot noir cannot be 1992. Thus, pinot noir must be 1996, and Friambliss must be 1992.
- From Clue 4, if Friambliss is 1992, then the 1984 wine must be Annata Branco, and pinot gris cannot be 1984. Thus, pinot gris is 1988.
- From Clue 3, if Ece Suss is either 1992 or 1996, and 1992 is Friambliss, then Ece Suss must be 1996.
- From Clue 2, if Ece Suss is 1996, then it must be syrah, and Zifennwein cannot be 1996. Thus, Zifennwein must be 1988.

"Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
- Clue 2 states that Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or the frat on Aspen Court.
- Clue 4 states that of Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road, one has 23 members and the other has 29 members.

Step 2: Deduce from Clue 2 and Clue 4
- If Tau Beta Pi has 23 members, it cannot be on Russell Road because Sigma Beta or the fraternity on Russell Road must have 23 or 29 members. Therefore, Tau Beta Pi must be on Aspen Court.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3
- Clue 1 states that the fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau.
- Clue 3 states that Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau.

Step 4: Deduce the number of members for Alpha Beta Tau
- Since the members are 23, 26, 29, 32, and Tau Beta Pi is not 23 (it's on Aspen Court), Alpha Beta Tau cannot be 23. If Alpha Beta Tau were 26, then the fraternity on Boom Court would have 23 members (26-3), and Beta Pi Omega would have 29 members (26+3). This fits with the available member numbers and does not conflict with other clues.

Step 5: Assign members to fraternities and streets
- Alpha Beta Tau has 26 members.
- The fraternity on Boom Court (23 members) cannot be Alpha Beta Tau or Beta Pi Omega (since it has 29 members). It must be Sigma Beta based on the elimination of other options.
- Beta Pi Omega has 29 members.
- Tau Beta Pi is on Aspen Court and has 32 members (since 23 is taken by Sigma Beta and 26, 29 are taken by Alpha Beta Tau and Beta Pi Omega).

"Step-by-step solution:
- Clue 1 states that Officer Yates is paired with either Jaws or Hercules, and one of them graduated in May. This means Yates is with either Jaws or Hercules, and May is paired with either Jaws or Hercules.
- Clue 2 indicates that Aries graduated sometime after Jaws. This means Jaws cannot be in June, and Aries cannot be in March.
- Clue 3 tells us that the dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman. This sets a specific order for Nolan and Zimmerman.
- Clue 4 states that the dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell. This means Fox cannot be paired with Tinkerbell, and Tinkerbell cannot be in March.

Using these clues, let's start filling the grid:
- Since Jaws and Hercules are linked to Yates and May, and Aries must be after Jaws, Jaws cannot be in May (as Aries would have no month to fit). Therefore, Hercules is in May and Yates is with Hercules.
- Since Jaws is before Aries and cannot be in May, Jaws must be in March or April. Since Aries must be after Jaws, Aries must be in June.
- Since Nolan's dog graduated 2 months before Zimmerman's, and Hercules (May) and Aries (June) are placed, Nolan's dog must be in March and Zimmerman's in May. Therefore, Nolan is with Jaws.
- Since Fox graduates before Tinkerbell and only April and June are left, Fox must be in March or April, and Tinkerbell in June. Since Nolan is already in March, Fox must be in April.
- Zimmerman is with Hercules in May, leaving Yates with Jaws in March.
- The only officer left for June is Yates, but since Yates is with Jaws in March, the officer in June must be Zimmerman. This is a contradiction, so Zimmerman must be in June with Aries, and the remaining officer for May, which is Yates, is already placed. The remaining officer for June is Fox.

"Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- The assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job. This means:
  - 50 | Mabel or Conference

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- Patrice's assignment will involve 50 more people than the retreat assignment. This means the retreat cannot have 125 people because no option exists for 175 people. Also, it cannot have 50 people because then Patrice would have 100, which doesn't fit any other clues directly yet.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The retreat job will involve somewhat fewer people than the graduation job. This means the retreat can't have the highest number of people (125).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- The symposium event will involve 25 more people than Clarence's assignment. This means:
  - If Clarence has 100, symposium has 125.
  - If Clarence has 75, symposium has 100.
  - If Clarence has 50, symposium has 75.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the symposium job and the graduation assignment, one will be handled by Mabel and the other will have 125 attendees. Since symposium can be 75, 100, or 125, and graduation must be more than the retreat, we can start narrowing down:
  - If symposium is 125, then it can't be Mabel's (as per Clue 4, Mabel could be 50). Thus, graduation is Mabel's and must be less than 125 but more than the retreat.

**Step 6: Deductions from Steps**
- Since the retreat must be fewer than graduation and graduation could be Mabel's, let's assign:
  - Retreat can't be 125. If retreat is 75, graduation could be 100 (Mabel's), and symposium 125.
  - This fits as Patrice then would have 125 (50 more than 75).

**Step 7: Final Assignments**
- Clarence can't be 50 (as it's either Mabel's or conference), so Clarence must be 75, making symposium 100.
- This means:
  - 50 | Conference
  - 75 | Clarence | Retreat
  - 100 | Mabel | Graduation

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- The snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The yellow balloon cost 2 dollars less than the red balloon.
  - This means the yellow balloon cannot be the most expensive ($6.00) or the least expensive ($3.00), as it needs a price exactly $2 higher available for the red balloon.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The dog cost 1 dollar more than the yellow piece.
  - Since the yellow balloon cannot be $3.00 (as it needs a price $1 higher for the dog), and it cannot be $6.00 (as it needs to be $2 less than the red balloon), the yellow balloon must be $4.00, making the dog $5.00.

**Step 4: Revisit Clue 5 with new information**
- Since the yellow balloon is $4.00, the red balloon must be $6.00.

**Step 5: Revisit Clue 4 with new information**
- Since the red balloon is $6.00, the snail must be the $3.00 balloon (as it can't be $6.00).

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 1**
- The monkey cost more than the gold animal.
  - Since the snail is $3.00 and not gold, and the dog is $5.00, the monkey must be $6.00 (as it costs more than any other option).

**Step 7: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red.
  - Since the $6.00 balloon is the monkey and is red, the cat must be orange.

"Step-by-step solution:
1. **Establishing Relationships from Clues:**
   - **Clue 2:** Velma Vintz's book costs $10 less than Tara Tyne's book.
   - **Clue 1:** The calculus book costs $5 more than Velma Vintz's book.

   Using these clues, we can establish a price relationship between Velma and Tara, and between Velma and the calculus book.

2. **Assigning Initial Prices:**
   - Let's assume Velma's book is priced at $29.99. According to Clue 2, Tara's book would then be $39.99.
   - According to Clue 1, the calculus book, costing $5 more than Velma's book, would be $34.99.

3. **Further Price Assignments:**
   - **Clue 5:** The pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99. Since Tara's book at $39.99 is calculus, pre-calculus must be $24.99.
   - **Clue 3:** The field theory book costs more than Mina Morton's book. Since the only prices higher than $24.99 are $29.99, $34.99, and $39.99, and calculus is $34.99, field theory must be $29.99.

4. **Author Assignments:**
   - **Clue 4:** The algebra book and the $39.99 title are either by Pat Peterson or Tara Tyne. Since Tara wrote the calculus book priced at $39.99, Pat Peterson must have written the algebra book.
   - Since calculus is $34.99 and field theory is $29.99, algebra must be the remaining price, which is $29.99.

5. **Finalizing the Table:**
   - Mina Morton's book is pre-calculus priced at $24.99.
   - Pat Peterson's book is algebra priced at $29.99.
   - Velma Vintz's book is field theory priced at $34.99.

"Step-by-step solution:
1. **Using Clue 1**: Methuselah is 32 years old. This is a direct placement.
2. **Using Clue 2**: The two rimmed tortoise is 36 years older than the horned tortoise. The possible ages for the tortoises are 14, 32, 50, and 68. Since Methuselah is 32 and not related to these species by the clues, the horned tortoise must be 14 and the two rimmed tortoise must be 50.
3. **Using Clue 3**: Chewie is either the pitch belly tortoise or the 50-year-old one. Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, Chewie cannot be 50 years old, so Chewie must be the pitch belly tortoise.
4. **Using Clue 4**: Of the black neck tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise, one is 68 years old and the other is named Shelly. Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, Shelly must be the two rimmed tortoise. Therefore, the black neck tortoise must be 68 years old.
5. **Assigning Remaining Names and Species**:
   - Methuselah is already determined as 32 years old.
   - The horned tortoise is 14 years old.
   - The two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old and named Shelly.
   - The black neck tortoise is 68 years old.
   - Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise.
   - The remaining tortoise, Yoda, must be the horned tortoise and 14 years old.
   - Since Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise and not 50 years old, Chewie must be 68 years old.
   - The remaining age, 68, must be associated with the black neck tortoise, which we already determined.
   - Since all other species are assigned, Methuselah must be the remaining species, which is black neck.

Final Answer:
14 | Yoda | horned
