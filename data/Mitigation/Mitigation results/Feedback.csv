341.json,"Nicholas and Edith are having a small dinner party this evening at their home in Cedar Valley, and they've decided to open a select number of rare wines from their personal collection to celebrate the occasion. Using only the clues below, match the vintages to the options from wines and types. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

vintages : 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996.
wines : Annata Branco, Bianca Flaux, Ece Suss, Vendemmia.
types : gewurztraminer, merlot, pinot noir, riesling.

Clues:
1. The Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.
2. The Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.
3. The 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.
4. The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.
5. The Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.
6. The 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1984 | correct option from wines | correct option from types
1988 | correct option from wines | correct option from types
1992 | correct option from wines | correct option from types
1996 | correct option from wines | correct option from types
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 6, we know that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer. This information will be used to eliminate gewurztraminer from other years.
 
 2. From clue 3, the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir. This information will be used to eliminate pinot noir from other years.
 
 3. From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. This means Ece Suss and Vendemmia cannot be merlot.
 
 4. From clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco. This means Annata Branco cannot be the latest year (1996) and Ece Suss cannot be the earliest year (1984).
 
 5. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. This means Bianca Flaux cannot be the earliest year (1984) and must be later than Ece Suss.
 
 6. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This helps us place these two wines in consecutive years that are 4 years apart.
 
 7. Since the Bianca Flaux must be after the Ece Suss and 4 years before the Vendemmia, and considering the years available (1984, 1988, 1992, 1996), the only arrangement that fits is:
  - Ece Suss in 1988 or 1992
  - Bianca Flaux in 1992
  - Vendemmia in 1996
 
 8. Since the 1988 bottle is pinot noir, and Ece Suss is the only option left for 1988, Ece Suss must be pinot noir.
 
 9. Since the 1984 bottle is gewurztraminer and the only wine left for 1984 is Annata Branco, Annata Branco must be gewurztraminer.
 
 10. Since Bianca Flaux is in 1992 and the only type left for 1992 is merlot (as per clue 4), Bianca Flaux must be merlot.
 
 11. The only remaining year and type for Vendemmia is 1996 and riesling.
 
 Final Answer:
 1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer
 1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir
 1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot
 1996 | Vendemmia | riesling","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze the clues related to the order of bottling.
- Clue 1 states that the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.
- Clue 5 states that the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.

From these clues, the order of bottling is: Annata Branco -> Ece Suss -> Bianca Flaux.

Step 2: Analyze the clues related to specific years and types.
- Clue 6 states that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.
- Clue 3 states that the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.

Step 3: Analyze the clues related to the difference in years.
- Clue 2 states that the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.

Step 4: Analyze the clues related to wine types.
- Clue 4 states that the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.

Step 5: Assign the years to the wines based on the clues.
- Since the Bianca Flaux is bottled after the Ece Suss and 4 years before the Vendemmia, and considering the order from Step 1, the only possible years for Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia that fit the 4-year gap are 1992 for Bianca Flaux and 1996 for Vendemmia.
- Since the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir, and the only wine left for 1988 is Ece Suss, Ece Suss must be the 1988 pinot noir.
- Since the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer, and the only wine left for 1984 is Annata Branco, Annata Branco must be the 1984 gewurztraminer.
- The remaining type for 1992 Bianca Flaux is merlot, and for 1996 Vendemmia is riesling.

placements : first, second, third, fourth.
roses : altissimo, bon silene, calocarpa, perle d'or.
gardeners : Hannah, Nellie, Renee, Tricia.

Clues:
1. The rose that won fourth place was Hannah's.
2. The flower that won second place, the calocarpa and the bon silene were all different flowers.
3. The altissimo won fourth place.
4. The bon silene finished 1 place ahead of Tricia's rose.

first | correct option from roses | correct option from gardeners
second | correct option from roses | correct option from gardeners
third | correct option from roses | correct option from gardeners
fourth | correct option from roses | correct option from gardeners
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 3, we know that the altissimo won fourth place. From clue 1, we know that the rose that won fourth place was Hannah's. Therefore, Hannah's rose is altissimo and it won fourth place.
 
 2. From clue 2, we know that the flower that won second place, the calocarpa, and the bon silene were all different flowers. Since altissimo is already in fourth place, it cannot be any of these flowers.
 
 3. From clue 4, the bon silene finished 1 place ahead of Tricia's rose. From clue 5, the bon silene finished 2 places ahead of Nellie's flower. This means bon silene must be in first place, Tricia's rose in second place, and Nellie's rose in third place.
 
 4. Since the bon silene is in first place and different from calocarpa (clue 2), and Tricia's rose is in second place, Tricia's rose must be calocarpa.
 
 5. Since Nellie's rose is in third place and it cannot be bon silene or calocarpa, and altissimo is already taken by Hannah, the only remaining option for Nellie's rose is perle d'or.
 
 6. The only remaining gardener for the first place (bon silene) is Renee.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 first | bon silene | Renee
 second | calocarpa | Tricia
 third | perle d'or | Nellie
 fourth | altissimo | Hannah","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3
- Clue 1 states that the rose that won fourth place was Hannah's.
- Clue 3 states that the altissimo won fourth place.
From these clues, we can conclude that Hannah's rose is altissimo and it won fourth place.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- Clue 2 states that the flower that won second place, the calocarpa, and the bon silene were all different flowers.
Since we know altissimo is fourth, calocarpa and bon silene cannot be fourth. We need to determine which one is second.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5
- Clue 4 states that the bon silene finished 1 place ahead of Tricia's rose.
- Clue 5 states that the bon silene finished 2 places ahead of Nellie's flower.
From these clues, we can deduce the relative positions of bon silene, Tricia's rose, and Nellie's flower. If bon silene is 1 place ahead of Tricia and 2 places ahead of Nellie, then if bon silene is third, Tricia's rose would be fourth (which is not possible as Hannah's rose is fourth), and Nellie's rose would be fifth (which is not possible as there are only four places). Therefore, bon silene must be second, Tricia's rose third, and Nellie's rose fourth. But since Hannah's rose is fourth, Nellie's rose must be first.

Step 4: Determine the remaining placements and roses
- Since bon silene is second and altissimo is fourth, and calocarpa cannot be second (from Clue 2), calocarpa must be first.
- The only remaining rose for third place is perle d'or.

Step 5: Assign the remaining gardener to the remaining rose
- The only remaining gardener for the first place is Renee.

Using only the clues below, match the scores to the options from a.i. and institutions. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

scores : 55%, 62%, 69%, 76%.
a.i. : Archimedes, Galen, Proclus, Zeno.
institutions : CIT, Exeter, Oxford, UCLA.

Clues:
1. Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA.
2. Galen scored 62%.
3. The A.I. that scored 76% was either Galen or the system from Oxford.

69% | correct option from a.i. | correct option from institutions
76% | correct option from a.i. | correct option from institutions
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 4, Proclus scored 76%. This eliminates Proclus from other scores and 76% from other A.I. options.
 2. From clue 2, Galen scored 62%. This eliminates Galen from other scores and 62% from other A.I. options.
 3. From clue 3, since Proclus scored 76%, Galen cannot be the one who scored 76%. Therefore, the system from Oxford scored 76%.
 4. From clue 5, the system that scored 55% was either from CIT or Zeno. Since Zeno is an A.I. and not an institution, this clue must mean that either Zeno scored 55% or the system from CIT scored 55%.
 5. From clue 1, Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA. Since Zeno cannot be 76% (Proclus is 76%) and cannot be 62% (Galen is 62%), Zeno must be either 55% or 69%. If Zeno were 55%, there would be no score 7% lower than 55% for UCLA. Therefore, Zeno must be 69%, and UCLA must be 62%.
 6. Since Zeno is 69%, the only remaining score for 55% must be associated with the remaining A.I., which is Archimedes. Since CIT was an option for 55%, Archimedes is from CIT.
 7. The only remaining institution for Proclus (76%) is Exeter, as Oxford is already taken by the 76% score.
 
 Final Answer:
 55% | Archimedes | CIT
 62% | Galen | UCLA
 69% | Zeno | Oxford
 76% | Proclus | Exeter","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
- Galen scored 62%.
- Proclus scored 76%.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- The A.I. that scored 76% was either Galen or the system from Oxford.
- Since Proclus scored 76%, this means Proclus is the system from Oxford.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 5
- The system that scored 55% was either the system from CIT or Zeno.
- Since Zeno cannot be from CIT (as CIT is an institution and Zeno is an A.I.), Zeno must have scored 55%.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 1
- Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA.
- Since Zeno scored 55%, the system from UCLA must have scored 55% - 7% = 48%, but since 48% is not an option, we need to re-evaluate. 
- Since Zeno scored 55%, the next possible score for UCLA would be 62% + 7% = 69%. Therefore, the system from UCLA scored 69%.

Step 5: Assign remaining scores and institutions
- Archimedes is the only A.I. left and must be the system from UCLA with a score of 69%.
- The remaining institution for Zeno is Exeter, as CIT and Oxford are already assigned.

Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

year sent : 1962, 1969, 1976, 1983.
writers : Felipe, Karla, Sean, Tracy.
origins : Bournemouth, Cherbourg, Le Havre, Plymouth.

Clues:
1. The message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg.
2. Tracy's letter was sent in 1962.
3. The bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive.
4. Sean's missive is either the letter that was sent in 1983 or the message that was sent in 1962.

1962 | correct option from writers | correct option from origins
1969 | correct option from writers | correct option from origins
1976 | correct option from writers | correct option from origins
1983 | correct option from writers | correct option from origins
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, Tracy's letter was sent in 1962. This gives us the first entry in our table.
 
 2. From Clue 5, Sean's bottle was from Le Havre. This means Sean did not send the bottle from Plymouth or Cherbourg.
 
 3. From Clue 4, Sean's missive is either the letter that was sent in 1983 or the message that was sent in 1962. Since Tracy's letter was sent in 1962, Sean's letter must have been sent in 1983. This also means Sean's letter is from Le Havre.
 
 4. From Clue 1, the message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg. This means if we add 14 years to the year the letter from Cherbourg was sent, we get the year the Plymouth letter was sent. The possible years for sending are 1962, 1969, 1976, and 1983. If Cherbourg's letter was sent in 1969, Plymouth's would be sent in 1983, but since 1983 is already taken by Sean's letter from Le Havre, Cherbourg's letter must have been sent in 1962, and Plymouth's in 1976. However, since Tracy's letter from 1962 is already identified and not from Cherbourg, Cherbourg's letter must be sent in another year. The only option left that fits is Cherbourg in 1969 and Plymouth in 1983. But since Sean's letter from Le Havre is in 1983, this is incorrect. Re-evaluating, Cherbourg must be in 1969 and Plymouth in 1983, but Sean's letter from Le Havre is in 1983. Thus, Cherbourg must be in 1962 and Plymouth in 1976.
 
 5. From Clue 3, the bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive. Since Tracy's letter is from 1962, Karla's must be from Plymouth in 1976.
 
 6. The remaining writer for 1969 from Cherbourg is Felipe, as Sean is in 1983 and Tracy in 1962, and Karla is in 1976.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 1962 | Tracy | Cherbourg
 1969 | Felipe | Bournemouth
 1976 | Karla | Plymouth
 1983 | Sean | Le Havre","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Tracy's letter was sent in 1962.
  - This directly places Tracy in 1962.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- Sean's bottle was from Le Havre.
  - This assigns the origin of Sean's message to Le Havre.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Sean's missive is either the letter that was sent in 1983 or the message that was sent in 1962.
  - Since Tracy's letter is already in 1962, Sean's letter must be in 1983.
  - This places Sean in 1983 and confirms the origin of his letter as Le Havre.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- The message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg.
  - This means the Plymouth letter is 14 years after the Cherbourg letter.
  - We need to find suitable years that fit this 14-year gap.

**Step 5: Determine possible years for Plymouth and Cherbourg**
- Possible pairs for a 14-year difference are (1969, 1983) or (1976, 1990) but 1990 is not an option.
  - Thus, Cherbourg's letter must be from 1969 and Plymouth's from 1983.

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 3**
- The bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive.
  - Since Tracy's letter is from 1962, Karla's letter must be from Plymouth and thus from 1983.
  - This places Karla in 1983 with the origin Plymouth.

**Step 7: Remaining Assignments**
- With Tracy in 1962, Sean and Karla placed in 1983, the only remaining writer for 1969 and 1976 is Felipe and the remaining writer.
- Since Cherbourg is 1969 and Le Havre is 1983, the remaining origin for 1976 is Bournemouth.

**Step 8: Assign Remaining Writer**
- The remaining writer for 1969 is Felipe (Cherbourg) and for 1976 is the only one left, which must be Sean.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
- 1962 | Tracy | (not Cherbourg, not Plymouth, not Le Havre) - Remaining is Bournemouth
- 1969 | Felipe | Cherbourg
- 1976 | (Remaining writer) | (Remaining origin)
- 1983 | Karla | Plymouth

**Correction:**
- Sean is in 1983 with Le Havre (from Clue 5 and Clue 4).
- The remaining writer for 1976 is the only one left, which must be Karla, but Karla is already placed in 1983. Thus, the remaining writer for 1976 is Sean, which is incorrect as per previous assignment. This needs to be corrected.

**Corrected Final Answer:**
- 1962 | Tracy | Bournemouth
- 1969 | Felipe | Cherbourg
- 1976 | (Remaining writer) | (Remaining origin)
- 1983 | Sean | Le Havre

**Final Correction:**
- The remaining writer for 1976 is Karla, and the origin is Plymouth. However, Karla is in 1983. Thus, the remaining writer for 1976 is not Karla but the only one left, which is Sean. This is incorrect as per previous assignment. Thus, the remaining writer for 1976 is the only one left, which must be Karla, and the origin is Plymouth.","1962 | Tracy | Cherbourg

shooting stars : 2, 9, 16, 23.
dates : April 7, April 10, April 17, April 22.
locations : Eastbrook, Gilmore City, Isleton, Manchester.

Clues:
1. The outing to Eastbrook logged 7 fewer shooting stars than the trip to Isleton.
2. The April 17 outing was in Gilmore City.
3. The outing where they saw 16 shooting stars was in Gilmore City.
4. The April 10 outing logged 7 more shooting stars than the April 22 outing.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
2 | correct option from dates | correct option from locations
9 | correct option from dates | correct option from locations
16 | correct option from dates | correct option from locations
23 | correct option from dates | correct option from locations
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze the clues
 - Clue 2 states that the April 17 outing was in Gilmore City.
 - Clue 3 states that the outing where they saw 16 shooting stars was in Gilmore City.
 
 From these two clues, we can deduce that on April 17, they saw 16 shooting stars in Gilmore City.
 
 Step 2: Use the remaining clues
 - Clue 4 states that the April 10 outing logged 7 more shooting stars than the April 22 outing.
 
 Since we know the number of shooting stars on April 17 is 16, we need to find two numbers from the remaining options (2, 9, 23) where one is 7 more than the other. The only numbers that fit this criterion are 9 and 2. Therefore, on April 10, they saw 9 shooting stars, and on April 22, they saw 2 shooting stars.
 
 Step 3: Use the first clue
 - Clue 1 states that the outing to Eastbrook logged 7 fewer shooting stars than the trip to Isleton.
 
 The only remaining number of shooting stars is 23. Since 23 is 7 more than 16, and 16 is already used for Gilmore City on April 17, 23 must be the number of shooting stars seen in Isleton. Since Eastbrook must have 7 fewer stars than Isleton, and the only number left is 2, Eastbrook must be the location where they saw 2 shooting stars.
 
 Step 4: Assign the remaining date and location
 - The only remaining date is April 7, and the only remaining location is Manchester. Since 9 shooting stars were seen on April 10 and the location for that date hasn't been assigned yet, Manchester must be the location for April 10.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 2 | April 22 | Eastbrook
 9 | April 10 | Manchester
 16 | April 17 | Gilmore City
 23 | April 7 | Isleton","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 3**
- Clue 2 states that the April 17 outing was in Gilmore City.
- Clue 3 states that the outing where they saw 16 shooting stars was in Gilmore City.

From these clues, we can conclude that on April 17 in Gilmore City, they saw 16 shooting stars.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that the April 10 outing logged 7 more shooting stars than the April 22 outing.

This clue helps us establish a relationship between the number of shooting stars seen on April 10 and April 22, but we need more information to assign specific numbers.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that the outing to Eastbrook logged 7 fewer shooting stars than the trip to Isleton.

This clue establishes a relationship between the number of shooting stars seen in Eastbrook and Isleton, but again, specific numbers are yet to be assigned.

**Step 4: Assign Remaining Dates and Locations**
- From Step 1, we know April 17 is taken by Gilmore City with 16 shooting stars.
- We need to assign the remaining dates (April 7, April 10, April 22) and locations (Eastbrook, Isleton, Manchester) to the remaining shooting star counts (2, 9, 23).

**Step 5: Apply Clue 4**
- Since April 10 has 7 more shooting stars than April 22, and we know the counts left are 2, 9, and 23, the only way to satisfy this with a difference of 7 is:
  - April 10 has 9 shooting stars, and April 22 has 2 shooting stars.

**Step 6: Apply Clue 1**
- Eastbrook has 7 fewer shooting stars than Isleton.
- With the remaining counts (2, 23), Eastbrook must have 2 shooting stars, and Isleton must have 9 shooting stars.

**Step 7: Assign Remaining Location**
- The only remaining location for the 23 shooting stars is Manchester.

**Step 8: Assign Remaining Date**
- The only remaining date for the 23 shooting stars is April 7.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
2 | correct option from guests | correct option from rooms
3 | correct option from guests | correct option from rooms
4 | correct option from guests | correct option from rooms
5 | correct option from guests | correct option from rooms
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 1, Underwood is in room 114.
 2. From clue 2, the guest in room 320 is staying 1 day fewer than Underwood. We need to determine Underwood's stay duration to use this clue.
 3. From clue 3, Owens is staying for 3 days.
 4. From clue 4, Parker is staying 1 day longer than the guest in room 314. We need to determine the stay duration of the guest in room 314 to use this clue.
 
 Let's analyze the days:
 - We have days 2, 3, 4, and 5 to assign.
 - Owens is staying for 3 days (clue 3).
 
 Now, let's assign rooms:
 - Underwood is in room 114 (clue 1).
 - We need to find out who is in rooms 124, 314, and 320.
 
 Using clue 2, since the guest in room 320 stays 1 day fewer than Underwood, we need to find Underwood's stay duration:
 - If Underwood stays for 4 days, then the guest in room 320 stays for 3 days. But Owens is already staying for 3 days, so this is not possible.
 - If Underwood stays for 5 days, then the guest in room 320 stays for 4 days. This is possible and does not conflict with any other information.
 
 So, Underwood stays for 5 days in room 114.
 
 Using clue 4, Parker stays 1 day longer than the guest in room 314:
 - If the guest in room 314 stays for 2 days, Parker stays for 3 days. But Owens is already staying for 3 days, so this is not possible.
 - If the guest in room 314 stays for 3 days, Parker stays for 4 days. This fits well with the remaining days and does not conflict with any other information.
 
 So, Parker stays for 4 days, and the guest in room 314 (Zamora, the only guest left) stays for 3 days.
 
 Now, the only guest and room left are Zamora and room 124, and the only day left is 2 days. So, Zamora stays in room 124 for 2 days.
 
 Final Answer:
 2 | Zamora | 124
 3 | Owens | 314
 4 | Parker | 320
 5 | Underwood | 114","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Assign Underwood to room 114 based on Clue 1.**
- Underwood is in room 114.

**Step 2: Determine the stay duration of the guest in room 320 based on Clue 2.**
- Since the guest in room 320 stays 1 day fewer than Underwood, we need to determine Underwood's stay duration first. However, we don't have direct information about Underwood's stay, so we'll need to use other clues to infer this.

**Step 3: Assign Owens to a 3-day stay based on Clue 3.**
- Owens is staying for 3 days.

**Step 4: Determine Parker's stay duration based on Clue 4.**
- Parker stays 1 day longer than the guest in room 314. We need to find out how many days the guest in room 314 stays to determine Parker's stay.

**Step 5: Analyze the possible days for each guest and room.**
- Since Owens is staying for 3 days, and Parker stays longer than the guest in room 314, Parker cannot be staying for 2 days. Therefore, Parker must be staying for either 4 or 5 days.
- If Parker stays for 4 days, then the guest in room 314 stays for 3 days. If Parker stays for 5 days, then the guest in room 314 stays for 4 days.

**Step 6: Assign days to Underwood and the guest in room 320.**
- Since Underwood is in room 114 and the guest in room 320 stays 1 day fewer, if Underwood stays for 4 days, then the guest in room 320 stays for 3 days. If Underwood stays for 5 days, then the guest in room 320 stays for 4 days.

**Step 7: Finalize the assignments based on the remaining options and logical deductions.**
- If Owens is staying for 3 days, and the guest in room 320 also stays for 3 days, there is a conflict unless Owens is in room 320. However, we know from Clue 1 that Underwood is in room 114, not Owens.
- Therefore, Underwood must stay for 5 days, and the guest in room 320 stays for 4 days. This makes Parker stay for 5 days (since Parker stays longer than the guest in room 314), and the guest in room 314 stays for 4 days.

This solution assumes that the guest in room 314 is Zamora, as this is the only guest left unassigned, and the room 124 is not mentioned in the clues, so it remains unassigned in this solution.","2 | Zamora | 124

341.json,"A group of friends has decided to try several different weight-loss diets and exercises to see who amongst them can lose the most weight in 3 months. Using only the clues below, match the pounds lost to the options from names and diets. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

pounds lost : 3, 5, 7, 9.
names : Raymond, Stuart, Tom, Wesley.

Clues:
1. Stuart lost 4 more pounds than the person who used the vegan diet.
2. The dieter who used the gluten-free diet lost 2 more pounds than Raymond.
3. Stuart lost 7 lbs.
4. The dieter who lost 7 lbs is either the person who used the caveman diet or Raymond.

5 | correct option from names | correct option from diets
7 | correct option from names | correct option from diets
9 | correct option from names | correct option from diets
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, we know Stuart lost 7 lbs.
 2. From Clue 4, since Stuart lost 7 lbs, he must be on the caveman diet or be Raymond. But since Stuart and Raymond are different people, Stuart must be on the caveman diet.
 3. From Clue 5, Wesley lost 5 lbs.
 4. From Clue 1, Stuart lost 4 more pounds than the person on the vegan diet. Since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet lost 3 lbs.
 5. From Clue 2, the person on the gluten-free diet lost 2 more pounds than Raymond. We need to find out how much Raymond lost to determine the weight loss of the person on the gluten-free diet.
 6. Since the pounds lost are 3, 5, 7, and 9, and we know Stuart lost 7 lbs, Wesley lost 5 lbs, and the vegan diet resulted in a 3 lb loss, the only remaining number for pounds lost is 9 lbs. This must be the weight loss for the person on the gluten-free diet.
 7. Since the gluten-free dieter lost 9 lbs and this is 2 more than Raymond, Raymond must have lost 7 lbs. However, since Stuart already lost 7 lbs, Raymond must have lost a different amount. Revisiting the clues, we realize that Raymond must have lost 5 lbs, but Wesley already lost 5 lbs. Therefore, Raymond must have lost 3 lbs, and the vegan diet person lost 3 lbs. This means Raymond is on the vegan diet.
 8. The only remaining diet is dairy-free, which must be Wesley's diet since all other diets are accounted for.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 3 | Raymond | vegan
 5 | Wesley | dairy-free
 7 | Stuart | caveman
 9 | Tom | gluten-free","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze the clues directly providing information about pounds lost.
- From Clue 3: Stuart lost 7 lbs.
- From Clue 5: Wesley lost 5 lbs.

Step 2: Use Clue 1 and Clue 3 to determine the pounds lost by the person on the vegan diet.
- Clue 1 states that Stuart lost 4 more pounds than the person who used the vegan diet.
- Since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet lost 7 - 4 = 3 lbs.

Step 3: Use Clue 2 to determine the pounds lost by the person on the gluten-free diet and identify Raymond's pounds lost.
- Clue 2 states that the dieter who used the gluten-free diet lost 2 more pounds than Raymond.
- Since the only remaining weights are 3, 5, and 9, and Wesley (5 lbs) and Stuart (7 lbs) are accounted for, Raymond must have lost either 3 lbs or 5 lbs. Since the vegan diet person lost 3 lbs and it's not Raymond (from Clue 4), Raymond must have lost 5 lbs.
- Therefore, the person on the gluten-free diet lost 5 + 2 = 7 lbs. But since Stuart lost 7 lbs and is not on the gluten-free diet (from Clue 4), this reasoning must be incorrect. Re-evaluate.

Step 4: Re-evaluate the pounds lost by Raymond and the gluten-free dieter.
- Since Raymond cannot have lost 3 lbs (vegan) or 7 lbs (Stuart), he must have lost 9 lbs.
- Therefore, the person on the gluten-free diet lost 9 + 2 = 11 lbs, which is not possible. Re-evaluate again.

Step 5: Re-evaluate the pounds lost by the gluten-free dieter.
- Since Raymond lost 9 lbs, the gluten-free dieter must have lost 9 - 2 = 7 lbs. This aligns with Stuart's weight loss, so Stuart is on the gluten-free diet.

Step 6: Assign the remaining diet.
- Wesley lost 5 lbs, and the only remaining pounds are 3 lbs for the vegan diet.
- The remaining diets are caveman and vegan. Since the vegan diet is associated with 3 lbs, and the caveman diet is not yet assigned, Tom must be on the caveman diet and lost 3 lbs.

Final Answer:
3 | Tom | caveman
5 | Wesley | dairy-free
7 | Stuart | gluten-free

2. The swallowtail butterfly cost 15 dollars more than Phillip's purchase.
3. The atlas butterfly cost  more than the peacock butterfly.

$45 | correct option from winners | correct option from butterflies
$60 | correct option from winners | correct option from butterflies
$75 | correct option from winners | correct option from butterflies
$90 | correct option from winners | correct option from butterflies
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 Yvette's purchase was either the insect that sold for $45 or the peacock butterfly. This means Yvette either bought the $45 butterfly or the peacock butterfly.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 The swallowtail butterfly cost $15 more than Phillip's purchase. This means Phillip's butterfly cost $15 less than the swallowtail.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 The atlas butterfly cost more than the peacock butterfly. This means the atlas butterfly is not the cheapest.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 The four butterflies were the butterfly that sold for $90, the grayling butterfly, Yvette's purchase, and Walter's purchase. This means these are the only options for the butterflies and their prices.
 
 Step 5: Deduce from Clues
 From Clue 1 and Clue 4, if Yvette's purchase was the peacock and not the $45 butterfly, then the $45 butterfly must be another option. Since the atlas costs more than the peacock, the atlas cannot be the cheapest. Therefore, Yvette must have bought the $45 butterfly or the peacock butterfly. If Yvette bought the peacock, it cannot be the cheapest or the most expensive ($90), so it must be either $60 or $75.
 
 Step 6: Further Deduction
 Since the swallowtail costs $15 more than Phillip's purchase, and the atlas costs more than the peacock, the atlas must be the $90 butterfly. This leaves the grayling and swallowtail to be either $60 or $75. Since the swallowtail is $15 more than Phillip's purchase, if Phillip's purchase was $60, the swallowtail would be $75. But since the atlas is $90, Phillip's purchase must be $75 - $15 = $60, making the swallowtail $75.
 
 Step 7: Assign Remaining Prices and Winners
 Phillip bought a butterfly for $60, and the swallowtail is $75. Walter's purchase is the only one left, which must be the grayling butterfly. Since the atlas is $90 and more expensive than the peacock, the peacock must be $60. Therefore, Yvette bought the $45 butterfly, which is not the peacock, leaving the only option for $45 as the grayling.
 
 Final Answer:
 $45 | Yvette | grayling
 $60 | Phillip | peacock
 $75 | Walter | swallowtail
 $90 | Otis | atlas","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
Yvette's purchase was either the insect that sold for $45 or the peacock butterfly. This means Yvette either bought the $45 butterfly or the peacock butterfly.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
The swallowtail butterfly cost $15 more than Phillip's purchase. This clue will be used later when we have more information about Phillip's purchase.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
The atlas butterfly cost more than the peacock butterfly. This means the atlas butterfly cannot be the cheapest.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
The four butterflies were the butterfly that sold for $90, the grayling butterfly, Yvette's purchase, and Walter's purchase. This clue confirms that these are the only four categories we are dealing with.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clue 1 and Clue 4**
Since Yvette's purchase was either $45 or the peacock, and the atlas costs more than the peacock, the atlas cannot be $45. Therefore, if Yvette bought the peacock, it cannot be the cheapest or the most expensive ($90). 

**Step 6: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 5**
Since the atlas costs more than the peacock and cannot be the cheapest, it must be more than $45. The only options left are $60, $75, or $90. Since the swallowtail costs $15 more than Phillip's purchase, and the atlas is not the cheapest, let's assume Phillip bought the cheapest ($45) and the swallowtail is $60.

**Step 7: Assign prices**
- Phillip's purchase: $45
- Swallowtail: $60 (from Step 6)
- Since the atlas costs more than the peacock and the swallowtail is $60, the atlas must be $75 or $90. Since the peacock is not the cheapest or the most expensive, it must be $75, and the atlas is $90.

**Step 8: Assign remaining butterflies and winners**
- Yvette's purchase: Peacock ($75)
- Walter's purchase: Atlas ($90)
- Otis must then have the remaining butterfly, which is the grayling, and the remaining price, which is $45.

June 11 | correct option from names | correct option from departures
June 12 | correct option from names | correct option from departures
June 13 | correct option from names | correct option from departures
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze the clues
 - Clue 3 states that Eugene will depart from Farley.
 - Clue 1 states that the person departing from Farley will leave 2 days before the person departing from Hardwick.
 
 Step 2: Assign Eugene and Farley
 - Since Eugene departs from Farley, we can place Eugene and Farley together.
 
 Step 3: Determine the days for Farley and Hardwick
 - From Clue 1, since Farley departs 2 days before Hardwick, and knowing Eugene is at Farley, we need to find a suitable day for Eugene that allows another day for Hardwick exactly 2 days later.
 
 Step 4: Place Eugene and Farley
 - If Eugene (Farley) departs on June 10, then Hardwick would be on June 12.
 
 Step 5: Use Clue 4
 - The conductor departing from Epworth will leave 1 day after Mitchell.
 - Since we know the days for Farley and Hardwick, Mitchell cannot be on June 10 or June 12. If Mitchell is on June 11, then Epworth would be on June 12, but June 12 is already taken by Hardwick. Thus, Mitchell must be on June 13, and Epworth on June 14, which is not possible as we only have days up to June 13. Therefore, Mitchell must be on June 10, and Epworth on June 11.
 
 Step 6: Assign remaining names and places
 - We have placed Eugene (Farley on June 10), Mitchell (Epworth on June 11), and Hardwick (June 12). The only remaining name is Roderick and the only remaining departure is Jackman, which must be on June 13.
 
 Step 7: Assign the remaining conductor
 - From Clue 2, the four conductors are the conductor departing from Farley, the conductor working on June 11, Mitchell, and Roderick. Since we know Mitchell is on June 10 and Roderick is on June 13, the conductor on June 11 must be Allen.
 
 Final Answer:
 June 10 | Eugene | Farley
 June 11 | Allen | Epworth
 June 12 | Mitchell | Hardwick
 June 13 | Roderick | Jackman","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**
- Eugene will depart from Farley.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person departing from Farley (Eugene) will leave 2 days before the person departing from Hardwick.
- Since there are only four days (June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13), Eugene can only depart on June 10 or June 11 to allow a 2-day gap. If Eugene departs on June 12 or June 13, there wouldn't be enough days left for a 2-day gap.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- The conductor departing from Epworth will leave 1 day after Mitchell.
- This means Mitchell cannot depart on June 13, as there would be no day after June 13.

**Step 4: Combine Clues 1 and 4**
- If Eugene (departing from Farley) leaves on June 10, then the person from Hardwick would leave on June 12.
- If Eugene leaves on June 11, then the person from Hardwick would leave on June 13.
- Since Mitchell needs a day after him for the Epworth departure, Mitchell cannot leave on June 12 (if Eugene leaves on June 10) because that would mean Epworth departure would be on June 13, leaving no room for Hardwick departure on June 13.
- Therefore, Eugene leaves on June 11, Hardwick departure is on June 13, and Mitchell leaves on June 12 with Epworth departure on June 13.

**Step 5: Assign Remaining Days and Names**
- Eugene departs from Farley on June 11.
- Mitchell departs on June 12, and the next day (June 13) is the departure from Epworth.
- Hardwick departure is on June 13, but since Mitchell is already assigned to June 12 and Epworth, the remaining name for June 13 is Roderick.
- The only remaining day without assignment is June 10, and the only remaining name and departure are Allen and Jackman.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 and Clue 4
 - Kurt Koch is the defensive end (Clue 3).
 - Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker (Clue 4).
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 - The person who played in 5 games last season is the quarterback.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
 - Edward Ellis played 2 more games than the defensive end.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 5
 - The running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games last season.
 
 Step 5: Deduce the number of games each player played
 - Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end and Edward Ellis played 2 more games than him, and considering the games available (3, 4, 5, 6), Kurt Koch must have played fewer games than Edward Ellis.
 - If Kurt Koch played 3 games (the minimum), Edward Ellis must have played 5 games (3 + 2 = 5). This fits with Clue 2, where the quarterback played 5 games. Therefore, Edward Ellis is the quarterback.
 
 Step 6: Determine the placekicker
 - Since Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker, and Kurt played 3 games, the placekicker played 5 games. But since Edward Ellis (the quarterback) played 5 games, this is not possible. Therefore, Kurt Koch must have played 4 games, and the placekicker played 6 games.
 
 Step 7: Assign the remaining player and position
 - The only remaining game number is 3, and the only remaining player is Gordon Gregg or Jack Jensen. Since the running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games (Clue 5), and Kurt Koch (defensive end) played 4 games, Gordon Gregg must be the running back who played 3 games.
 - Jack Jensen is the remaining player and must be the placekicker who played 6 games.
 
 Final Answer:
 3 | Gordon Gregg | running back
 4 | Kurt Koch | defensive end
 5 | Edward Ellis | quarterback
 6 | Jack Jensen | placekicker","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- The person who played in 5 games last season is the quarterback.
  - This directly places the quarterback in game 5.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Kurt Koch is the defensive end.
  - This assigns Kurt Koch as the defensive end.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker.
  - Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end, we need to find his game number to determine the placekicker's game number.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- Edward Ellis played 2 more games than the defensive end.
  - This clue will help once we know which game the defensive end (Kurt Koch) played.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games last season.
  - This clue suggests that Gordon Gregg could be the running back or someone else who played in 4 games.

**Step 6: Assigning Games**
- Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end and Edward Ellis played 2 more games than him, and the quarterback (unknown player) played 5 games:
  - If Kurt Koch played 3 games, Edward Ellis would have played 5 games. But the quarterback is already in game 5.
  - If Kurt Koch played 4 games, Edward Ellis would have played 6 games. This fits without conflicts.

**Step 7: Placekicker's Game**
- From Step 6, Kurt Koch played 4 games. According to Clue 4, the placekicker played 2 more games than Kurt Koch, which means the placekicker played 6 games.

**Step 8: Remaining Player and Position**
- Jack Jensen must be the placekicker since he is the only player left for game 6.
- Gordon Gregg, by elimination and Clue 5, must be the running back and played in 3 games.

1. Violet's pet is the boxer.
2. Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu.
3. Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab.
4. The four puppies are Rosie's pet, the dog adopted in April, the puppy adopted in February and the puppy adopted in March.

January | correct option from owners | correct option from dog breeds
February | correct option from owners | correct option from dog breeds
March | correct option from owners | correct option from dog breeds
April | correct option from owners | correct option from dog breeds
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, we know Violet's pet is the boxer.
 2. From Clue 2, Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu. This means the shih tzu was adopted in either January or February, and Kayla's pet was adopted in either March or April.
 3. From Clue 3, Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab. This means the black lab was adopted in either February, March, or April, and Rosie's pet was adopted in either January, February, or March.
 4. From Clue 4, we know that the four puppies are Rosie's pet, the dog adopted in April, the puppy adopted in February, and the puppy adopted in March. This means Rosie's pet is not the dog adopted in April.
 
 Let's start placing the information:
 - Violet has the boxer.
 - Rosie's pet is not the dog adopted in April.
 
 Since Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab, and the black lab cannot be adopted in January (as it would mean Rosie's pet was adopted in December, which is not listed), the earliest Rosie's pet can be adopted is February, and the black lab in March. This fits as Rosie's pet is one of the puppies, and the puppy adopted in March is also a puppy.
 
 This leaves:
 - Rosie's pet adopted in February.
 - Black lab adopted in March.
 
 Since Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu, and the shih tzu cannot be adopted in March (as it would mean Kayla's pet was adopted in May, which is not listed), the shih tzu must be adopted in January, and Kayla's pet in March.
 
 This leaves:
 - Shih tzu adopted in January.
 - Kayla's pet (unknown breed) adopted in March.
 
 Since Violet has the boxer and the boxer is not listed as adopted in March or January (as those slots are filled by the shih tzu and Kayla's pet), Violet's boxer must be adopted in April.
 
 This leaves:
 - Violet with the boxer in April.
 
 The only remaining slot is for Lydia, and the only remaining breed is the schnauzer, which must be adopted in February.
 
 Final Answer:
 January | Lydia | shih tzu
 February | Rosie | schnauzer
 March | Kayla | black lab
 April | Violet | boxer","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- Violet's pet is the boxer.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu.
  This means Kayla did not adopt the shih tzu and there are two months between the adoption of the shih tzu and Kayla's pet.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab.
  This means Rosie did not adopt the black lab and there is one month between the adoption of Rosie's pet and the black lab.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The four puppies are Rosie's pet, the dog adopted in April, the puppy adopted in February, and the puppy adopted in March.
  This clue confirms that all months had adoptions, and Rosie's pet is one of them.

Step 5: Deductions from Clues 2 and 3
- Since Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu, and Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab, we can start placing possible months for these pets.
- If the shih tzu was adopted in January, then Kayla's pet would be in March. But if the shih tzu was adopted in February, then Kayla's pet would be in April.

Step 6: Further Deductions
- Since Violet's pet is the boxer, and Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab, Rosie cannot have the boxer or the black lab. Therefore, Rosie must have either the schnauzer or the shih tzu.

Step 7: Placing Rosie
- If Rosie had the schnauzer, and considering the black lab was adopted a month after Rosie's pet, the black lab cannot be in January or February (as it needs a month after Rosie's pet). If Rosie's pet is in February (schnauzer), then the black lab would be in March.

Step 8: Placing Kayla and the Shih Tzu
- If the shih tzu was adopted in January, Kayla's adoption in March fits as it is 2 months after. This leaves April for the black lab, which fits with Rosie's pet being in February and the black lab being a month after.

Step 9: Final Placement
- Violet has the boxer, but the month is not yet determined. Since all other pets and months are placed, Violet with the boxer must be in January.

Final Answer:
January | Violet | boxer
February | Rosie | schnauzer
March | Kayla | shih tzu
April | Lydia | black lab

This arrangement satisfies all clues and logical deductions without contradicting any given information.","January | Rosie | shih tzu

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, Gracie is 11 years old.
 2. From Clue 3, the 11-year-old condor (Gracie) has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old bird.
 3. From Clue 5, the condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 12 years old.
 4. From Clue 4, the 9-year-old condor is either the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches or Angel. Since the 114-inch wingspan bird is 12 years old (from Clue 5), the 9-year-old must be Angel.
 5. From Clue 2, the four condors are the 9-year-old condor (Angel), the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches, Buddy, and the condor with a wingspan of 110 inches.
 6. Since Gracie is 11 years old and her wingspan is 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old's (Angel), and since Angel cannot have a wingspan of 114 inches (as it belongs to the 12-year-old), Angel must have a wingspan of 110 inches. Therefore, Gracie's wingspan is 106 inches (110 - 4).
 7. The remaining wingspan of 102 inches must belong to Buddy, as he is one of the four mentioned in Clue 2 and not yet assigned a wingspan.
 8. The only remaining age and wingspan combination is for Smokey, who must be 12 years old with a wingspan of 114 inches.
 
 Final Answer:
 102 inches | Buddy | 8
 106 inches | Gracie | 11
 110 inches | Angel | 9
 114 inches | Smokey | 12","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Gracie is 11 years old.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 12 years old.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The 11-year-old condor (Gracie) has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old bird.
- Since the 12-year-old condor has a wingspan of 114 inches, the 9-year-old cannot have this wingspan.
- Therefore, the 9-year-old must have a wingspan of 110 inches (114 - 4 = 110).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The 9-year-old condor is either the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches or Angel.
- Since the 9-year-old has a wingspan of 110 inches, the 9-year-old must be Angel.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clue 2**
- The four condors are the 9-year-old condor (Angel with 110 inches), the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches, Buddy, and the condor with a wingspan of 110 inches.
- Since Angel is the 9-year-old with 110 inches, Buddy must have a different wingspan and age.

**Step 6: Assign remaining wingspans and ages**
- We know:
  - 114 inches is 12 years old.
  - 110 inches is 9 years old (Angel).
  - 11 years old (Gracie) must have a wingspan of 106 inches (110 - 4 = 106).
- The remaining wingspan of 102 inches must be assigned to the remaining age, which is 8 years old.

**Step 7: Assign Buddy**
- Buddy is not 9 years old (Angel) or 11 years old (Gracie) or 12 years old (114 inches).
- Therefore, Buddy must be 8 years old with a wingspan of 102 inches.

**Step 8: Assign Smokey**
- The only remaining combination is Smokey, who must be 12 years old with a wingspan of 114 inches.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
102 inches | Buddy | 8

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, we know that the Disty launched in March.
 2. From Clue 4, we know that the Iunsel is going to Pluto.
 3. From Clue 5, the Iunsel launched 1 month before the mission going to Uranus. This means the Iunsel cannot be in March (since it's 1 month before Uranus and March is already occupied by Disty). Therefore, Iunsel must be in February and the mission to Uranus must be in March.
 4. From Clue 1, the Iunsel launched sometime after the probe going to Mercury. This means the probe going to Mercury must be in January.
 5. From Clue 3, the Moro Jaddo launched 1 month after the mission going to Uranus. Since Uranus is in March, Moro Jaddo must be in April.
 6. The only remaining month for a probe is January, and the only remaining probe is Viria Mari. Therefore, Viria Mari launched in January.
 7. The only remaining destination not yet assigned is Ganymede. Since the only month left without a destination is April, Ganymede must be the destination for Moro Jaddo.
 
 Final Answer:
 January | Viria Mari | Mercury
 February | Iunsel | Pluto
 March | Disty | Uranus
 April | Moro Jaddo | Ganymede","Step-by-step solution:

1. **Starting with Clue 2**: The Disty launched in March.
   - March | Disty | ?

2. **Using Clue 4**: The Iunsel is going to Pluto.
   - ? | Iunsel | Pluto

3. **Using Clue 5**: The Iunsel launched 1 month before the mission going to Uranus.
   - Since Iunsel is linked to Pluto, the mission to Uranus must be the month after Iunsel.

4. **Using Clue 1**: The Iunsel launched sometime after the probe going to Mercury.
   - This means the probe to Mercury must be launched before Iunsel.

5. **Using Clue 3**: The Moro Jaddo launched 1 month after the mission going to Uranus.
   - Since Moro Jaddo is exactly one month after Uranus, and Iunsel (Pluto) is one month before Uranus, we can start placing them.

6. **Placement of Iunsel and Uranus**:
   - Since Iunsel is after the Mercury mission and before Uranus, and Moro Jaddo is after Uranus, the only arrangement that fits all clues is:
     - January | ? | Mercury
     - February | Iunsel | Pluto
     - March | Disty | ?
     - April | Moro Jaddo | Uranus

7. **Remaining Probe and Destination**:
   - The only remaining probe is Viria Mari and the only remaining destination is Ganymede.
   - Since Disty is in March and no other information contradicts, we place Viria Mari in January going to Mercury.

8. **Finalizing March Destination**:
   - The only destination left for March (Disty) is Ganymede.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, Randy Reid left 1 day after the journalist who covered the solar eclipse. This means the solar eclipse coverage cannot be on April 7th, and Randy Reid cannot be on April 4th.
 
 2. From Clue 4, Linda Lott left 1 day before the journalist who covered the flooding. This means Linda Lott cannot be on April 7th, and the flooding cannot be on April 4th.
 
 3. From Clue 1, the four people mentioned (reporter on April 7th, reporter on solar eclipse, reporter on earthquake, Randy Reid) are all different. Since Randy Reid is one of them, he cannot be the reporter on April 7th, nor can he cover the solar eclipse or the earthquake.
 
 4. From Clue 2, Sid Snyder left 1 day after Tam Terry. This means Tam Terry cannot be on April 7th, and Sid Snyder cannot be on April 4th.
 
 5. Since Randy Reid left 1 day after the solar eclipse, and he cannot be on April 4th, the solar eclipse must have been on April 4th, and Randy Reid must have left on April 5th.
 
 6. Since Linda Lott left 1 day before the flooding, and the flooding cannot be on April 4th, Linda Lott must have left on April 5th, and the flooding must have been on April 6th.

 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 April 4th | Sid Snyder | solar eclipse
 April 5th | Randy Reid | royal wedding
 April 6th | Tam Terry | flooding
 April 7th | Linda Lott | earthquake","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The four people mentioned are: the reporter on April 7th, the reporter who covered the solar eclipse, the journalist who covered the earthquake, and Randy Reid. This implies these are four different people.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Randy Reid left 1 day after the journalist who covered the solar eclipse. This means Randy Reid cannot be the reporter on April 7th, as there is no day after April 7th. Therefore, the solar eclipse must have been covered on April 6th, and Randy Reid reported on April 7th.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Linda Lott left 1 day before the journalist who covered the flooding. Since Randy Reid is on April 7th and not covering flooding, and the solar eclipse is on April 6th, Linda Lott must have left on April 5th. Therefore, flooding was covered on April 6th.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Sid Snyder left 1 day after Tam Terry. Since Randy Reid is on April 7th and Linda Lott is on April 5th, Tam Terry must be on April 4th, and Sid Snyder on April 5th.

**Step 5: Assign Remaining Stories**
- From Clue 1, the earthquake must be covered by someone other than Randy Reid, Sid Snyder, and the reporter on April 7th. Since flooding is on April 6th and solar eclipse on April 6th, the only remaining day for the earthquake is April 4th.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Reporters and Stories**
- Since Randy Reid is on April 7th, and Sid Snyder is on April 5th, the only remaining reporter for April 4th is Tam Terry. The remaining story for April 7th is the royal wedding.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower. This information will help us eliminate Wayne and Seattle Tower from other options.
 
 2. From Clue 4, the person with the $15.50 fare was picked up at the Camlin Hotel. This eliminates the $15.50 fare and Camlin Hotel from other options.
 
 3. From Clue 3, Della was either the client with the $12.50 fare or the person who got picked up at the Seattle Tower. Since Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower, Della must be the client with the $12.50 fare. This eliminates Della and the $12.50 fare from other options.
 
 4. From Clue 2, Elvira paid $6 less than the customer who got picked up at the Moore Mansion. Since the remaining fare options are $6.50 and $9.50, and $6.50 is $6 less than $12.50, Elvira must have paid $6.50, and the person picked up at the Moore Mansion must have paid $12.50. Since Della paid $12.50, Della was picked up at the Moore Mansion. This eliminates Elvira, $6.50 fare, and Moore Mansion from other options.
 
 5. Now, we know:
  - Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower.
  - Della was picked up at the Moore Mansion and paid $12.50.
  - Elvira paid $6.50.
  - The person picked up at the Camlin Hotel paid $15.50.
 
 6. The remaining customer is Isabel, and the remaining pickup point is Neptune Theatre. The remaining fare is $9.50. Therefore, Isabel paid $9.50 and was picked up at Neptune Theatre.
 
 Final Answer:
 $6.50 | Elvira | Moore Mansion
 $9.50 | Isabel | Neptune Theatre
 $12.50 | Della | Seattle Tower
 $15.50 | Wayne | Camlin Hotel","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze given clues**
- Clue 1: Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower.
- Clue 4: The person with the $15.50 fare was picked up at the Camlin Hotel.

**Step 2: Apply Clue 1 and Clue 4**
- Wayne at Seattle Tower.
- $15.50 fare at Camlin Hotel.

**Step 3: Apply Clue 3**
- Della was either the client with the $12.50 fare or the person who got picked up at the Seattle Tower.
- Since Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower, Della must be the client with the $12.50 fare.

**Step 4: Apply Clue 2**
- Elvira paid $6 less than the customer who got picked up at the Moore Mansion.
- Since the fares are $6.50, $9.50, $12.50, $15.50, and Della has $12.50, the only way Elvira could pay $6 less than another fare is if she paid $6.50 and the Moore Mansion fare was $12.50. However, Della has the $12.50 fare and she is not at the Moore Mansion. Therefore, the Moore Mansion fare must be $15.50, and Elvira must have the $9.50 fare.

**Step 5: Assign remaining fare and pickup point**
- Wayne is at Seattle Tower.
- Della has $12.50 fare.
- Elvira has $9.50 fare and the only remaining fare is $6.50 which must be for Isabel.
- Since Camlin Hotel and Seattle Tower are taken by the $15.50 fare and Wayne respectively, and Moore Mansion is linked with the $15.50 fare, the remaining pickup point for Isabel ($6.50 fare) is Neptune Theatre.

**Step 6: Assign remaining customer to remaining fare and pickup point**
- Wayne is at Seattle Tower.
- Della has $12.50 fare.
- Elvira has $9.50 fare and is not at Moore Mansion or Seattle Tower or Camlin Hotel, so she must be at Neptune Theatre.
- Isabel has $6.50 fare and the remaining pickup point is Moore Mansion.

October 5 | correct option from customers | correct option from cake shapes
October 6 | correct option from customers | correct option from cake shapes
October 7 | correct option from customers | correct option from cake shapes
October 8 | correct option from customers | correct option from cake shapes
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 5, we know that the cake delivered on October 7 is shaped like a bowling pin. 
 
 2. From Clue 3, since the bowling pin is delivered on October 7, it cannot be delivered on October 5. Therefore, the bowling pin is Mrs. Ingram's cake. 
 
 3. From Clue 4, Mrs. Nolan's cake is shaped like a sports car. 
 
 4. From Clue 1, Mrs. Danielson's cake is delivered 1 day before the sports car. Since Mrs. Nolan's sports car cake cannot be on October 5 (as it's too early for a day before), and it cannot be on October 7 (bowling pin is already scheduled), it must be on October 8. Therefore, Mrs. Danielson's cake is delivered on October 7.
 
 5. From Clue 2, the turtle-shaped cake is delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake. Since Mrs. Ingram's cake is delivered on October 7, the turtle-shaped cake must be delivered on October 5.
 
 6. The remaining shape, baseball glove, and the remaining date, October 6, must be for the remaining customer, Estrada.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 October 5 | Estrada | turtle
 October 6 | Danielson | baseball glove
 October 7 | Ingram | bowling pin
 October 8 | Nolan | sports car","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 5
- The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake.
- Since the bowling pin is already assigned to October 7 from Step 1, it must be Mrs. Ingram's cake.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
- Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 1
- Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the order shaped like a sports car.
- Since Mrs. Nolan's cake is the sports car, and Mrs. Danielson's cake is delivered 1 day before, Mrs. Danielson's cake must be delivered on October 6 (assuming Mrs. Nolan's sports car cake is delivered on October 7, but we know from Step 1 that October 7 is the bowling pin).

Step 5: Analyze Clue 2
- The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake.
- Since Mrs. Ingram's cake is the bowling pin delivered on October 7, the turtle must be delivered on October 5.

Step 6: Assign Remaining Options
- We have assigned cakes for October 5 (turtle), October 7 (bowling pin, Mrs. Ingram), and Mrs. Nolan's cake (sports car).
- Mrs. Danielson's cake is 1 day before the sports car, which must be October 6.
- The only remaining date is October 8, and the only remaining customer is Estrada.
- The only remaining cake shape is the baseball glove.

Final Answer:
October 5 | Estrada | turtle

Using only the clues below, match the years to the options from species and populations. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

years : 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009.
species : eldar elk, nibner newt, osbele oryx, perens pig.
populations : 210, 280, 315, 385.

Clues:
1. The nibner newt was listed 2 years before the species with a population size of 385.
2. The perens pig is either the animal added to the list in 2006 or the species with a population size of 315.
3. The nibner newt was recognized as endangered in 2006.
4. The species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.

2007 | correct option from species | correct option from populations
2008 | correct option from species | correct option from populations
2009 | correct option from species | correct option from populations
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: From Clue 3, we know the nibner newt was recognized as endangered in 2006. 
 
 Step 2: From Clue 1, since the nibner newt was listed 2 years before the species with a population size of 385, the species with 385 population must have been listed in 2008.
 
 Step 3: From Clue 4, the species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx. Since the nibner newt is already placed in 2006, and the species with 385 population is in 2008, it can't be the perens pig (as per Clue 2, the perens pig is either in 2006 or has a population of 315). Therefore, the osbele oryx must be the species with a population of 385 in 2008.
 
 Step 4: From Clue 2, the perens pig is either in 2006 or has a population of 315. Since 2006 is already taken by the nibner newt, the perens pig must have a population of 315. The only years left for the perens pig are 2007 or 2009.
 
 Step 5: From Clue 5, the perens pig was listed sometime before the species with a population size of 210. This means the perens pig must be in 2007 (since it must be before the species with 210 population, which then must be in 2009).
 
 Step 6: The only species left to assign is the eldar elk, and the only year left is 2009. The only population left is 210. Therefore, the eldar elk must be the species with a population of 210 in 2009.
 
 Final Answer:
 2006 | nibner newt | 280
 2007 | perens pig | 315
 2008 | osbele oryx | 385
 2009 | eldar elk | 210","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- The nibner newt was recognized as endangered in 2006.
  Therefore, 2006 | nibner newt | unknown population

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- The nibner newt was listed 2 years before the species with a population size of 385.
  Since the nibner newt was listed in 2006, the species with a population of 385 must have been listed in 2008.
  Therefore, 2008 | unknown species | 385

Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
- The species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.
  Since 2008 has a population of 385, the species must be either perens pig or osbele oryx.
  Therefore, 2008 | perens pig or osbele oryx | 385

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The perens pig is either the animal added to the list in 2006 or the species with a population size of 315.
  Since 2006 is already occupied by the nibner newt, the perens pig must have a population of 315.
  Therefore, perens pig cannot be in 2008 as it has a population of 385. Thus, 2008 | osbele oryx | 385

Step 5: Place the perens pig
- From Step 4, perens pig has a population of 315, and it's not in 2006 or 2008.
  Therefore, 2007 | perens pig | 315

Step 6: Analyze Clue 5
- The perens pig was listed sometime before the species with a population size of 210.
  Since perens pig is in 2007, the species with a population of 210 must be in 2009.
  Therefore, 2009 | unknown species | 210

Step 7: Remaining species and population
- The remaining species are eldar elk and the remaining population is 280.
  Since 2006 and 2007 are occupied, and 2009 has a population of 210, the only year left for eldar elk with a population of 280 is 2009.
  Therefore, 2009 | eldar elk | 280

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
2006 | nibner newt | unknown population

105 decibels | correct option from sirens | correct option from years
110 decibels | correct option from sirens | correct option from years
115 decibels | correct option from sirens | correct option from years
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, the siren with 105 decibels is either the Bradley X9 or the siren released in 2009.
 2. From Clue 2, the siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009. This means the siren in 1999 must be less than 105 decibels if the 2009 siren could be 105 decibels.
 3. From Clue 3, the Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm.
 4. From Clue 4, the Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide.
 5. From Clue 5, the Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998.
 
 Let's start piecing the information together:
 - If the Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998, and since the decibels are 100, 105, 110, 115, the Rip Tide cannot be 115 decibels. If the Rip Tide were 100 decibels, the 1998 siren would be 110 decibels.
 - From Clue 4, if the Rip Tide is 100 decibels, then the Soundarm would be 105 decibels.
 - From Clue 3, if the Soundarm is 105 decibels, then the Bradley X9 would be 115 decibels.
 - From Clue 1, since the Bradley X9 is 115 decibels, the siren with 105 decibels released in 2009 must be the Soundarm.
 
 Now we know:
 - Rip Tide is 100 decibels.
 - Soundarm is 105 decibels and released in 2009.
 - Bradley X9 is 115 decibels.
 - The siren released in 1998 is 110 decibels, and since all other sirens are assigned, the only one left for 1998 is Securalert.
 - The siren released in 1999 must be quieter than 105 decibels, so it must be the Rip Tide at 100 decibels.
 
 Final Answer:
 100 decibels | Rip Tide | 1999
 105 decibels | Soundarm | 2009
 110 decibels | Securalert | 1998
 115 decibels | Bradley X9 | (year not specified, but since all other years are taken, it must be 2007)","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The siren with a loudness of 105 decibels is either the siren released in 2009 or the Bradley X9.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- The siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009.
  - This implies the siren in 1999 has fewer decibels than the siren in 2009.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm.
  - If Bradley X9 is 105 decibels (from Clue 1), then Soundarm must be 95 decibels, but since 95 is not an option, Bradley X9 cannot be 105 decibels. Therefore, the siren in 2009 must be 105 decibels.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide.
  - This sets a relative scale between Soundarm and Rip Tide.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998.
  - This helps establish a relationship between Rip Tide and the 1998 siren.

**Step 6: Deduce from Clues 3, 4, and 5**
- If we assume Rip Tide is 100 decibels (the lowest available), then Soundarm would be 105 decibels. However, from Clue 1, the 105 decibels siren is in 2009, which conflicts with the Soundarm being 105 decibels. Therefore, Rip Tide cannot be 100 decibels.
- If Rip Tide is 105 decibels, Soundarm would be 110 decibels, and Bradley X9 would be 120 decibels, which is not possible. So, Rip Tide must be 95 decibels, which is also not possible as 95 is not an option.
- Therefore, Rip Tide must be 100 decibels, Soundarm 105 decibels, and Bradley X9 115 decibels.

**Step 7: Assign years based on decibels and remaining clues**
- Since Rip Tide is 100 decibels and 10 decibels quieter than the 1998 siren, the 1998 siren must be 110 decibels.
- Since the 2009 siren is 105 decibels, it must be the Soundarm.
- Since the Bradley X9 is 115 decibels, it must be the remaining year not yet used, which is 2007.
- The remaining siren, Securalert, must be 110 decibels and from 1998.

**Final Answer:**
```
100 decibels | Rip Tide          | 1999
105 decibels | Soundarm          | 2009
110 decibels | Securalert        | 1998

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we know Henrietta's design was silver and went 35 feet.
  - 35 feet | Henrietta | silver
 
 2. From Clue 3, Omar's design went farther than the silver airplane (which went 35 feet). The only distance farther than 35 feet is 45 feet.
  - 45 feet | Omar | (color to be determined)
 
 3. From Clue 5, the pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane. This means the black plane must have gone either 15 feet or 25 feet, as the pink plane must also fit within the available distances.
 
 4. From Clue 4, Ella's design went 10 feet farther than the black plane. This means if the black plane went 15 feet, Ella's would have gone 25 feet, and if the black plane went 25 feet, Ella's would have gone 35 feet. But since 35 feet is already taken by Henrietta, the black plane must have gone 15 feet and Ella's went 25 feet.
  - 15 feet | (student to be determined) | black
  - 25 feet | Ella | (color to be determined)
 
 5. From Clue 5 and the above deduction, the pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane (which went 15 feet), so the pink plane went 25 feet. But since Ella's plane went 25 feet, Ella's plane must be pink.
  - 25 feet | Ella | pink
 
 6. Now, we know:
  - 15 feet | (student to be determined) | black
  - 25 feet | Ella | pink
  - 35 feet | Henrietta | silver
  - 45 feet | Omar | (color to be determined)
 
 7. The only student left for the 15 feet distance is Valerie, as Henrietta, Ella, and Omar are already assigned.
  - 15 feet | Valerie | black
 
 8. The only color left for Omar's 45 feet plane is blue, as black, pink, and silver are already assigned.
  - 45 feet | Omar | blue
 
 Final Answer:
 15 feet | Valerie | black
 25 feet | Ella | pink
 35 feet | Henrietta | silver
 45 feet | Omar | blue","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Assign Henrietta's design based on clues 1 and 2.
- Henrietta's airplane went 35 feet and was silver.

Step 2: Determine Omar's airplane based on clue 3.
- Omar's airplane went farther than the silver airplane (which went 35 feet). The only distances farther than 35 feet are 45 feet. Therefore, Omar's airplane went 45 feet.

Step 3: Analyze clues 4 and 5 to determine the distances of the black and pink airplanes.
- Since the pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane, and Ella's design went 10 feet farther than the black plane, we need to find two distances that are 10 feet apart and include the remaining distances (15 feet and 25 feet). The only way to arrange this is to have the black plane at 15 feet and the pink plane at 25 feet. Consequently, Ella's airplane went 25 feet.

Step 4: Assign the remaining student and color to the remaining distance.
- Valerie is the only student left, and blue is the only color left. Since the only remaining distance is 15 feet, Valerie's airplane, which is blue, went 15 feet.

2009 | correct option from astronomers | correct option from comets
2010 | correct option from astronomers | correct option from comets
2011 | correct option from astronomers | correct option from comets
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 1, we know that Casputi was discovered in 2009.
 2. From clue 2, Jack Ingram discovered a comet in 2008.
 3. From clue 3, Underwood discovered a comet in 2010 (2 years after 2008).
 4. From clue 4, Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. Since we don't know Hal's year yet, we'll keep this in mind.
 5. From clue 5, the comet discovered in 2010 is either the one Ken Jones discovered or Crecci. Since Underwood discovered a comet in 2010, it must be either Crecci or Ken Jones discovered Crecci in 2010.
 
 Now, let's fill in what we know:
 - 2008 | Jack Ingram | (unknown comet)
 - 2009 | (unknown astronomer) | Casputi
 - 2010 | Underwood | (either Crecci or Ken Jones discovered Crecci)
 - 2011 | (unknown astronomer) | (unknown comet)
 
 Since Underwood discovered a comet in 2010, and it's either Crecci or Ken Jones discovered Crecci, we can deduce that Underwood discovered Crecci in 2010.
 
 Now, we know:
 - 2008 | Jack Ingram | (unknown comet)
 - 2009 | (unknown astronomer) | Casputi
 - 2010 | Underwood | Crecci
 - 2011 | (unknown astronomer) | (unknown comet)
 
 Since Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet, and the only years left for Hal are 2011, Peinope must have been discovered in 2010. But since 2010 is already taken by Underwood and Crecci, Peinope must have been discovered in 2009, and Hal Gregory discovered his comet in 2010. This contradicts our earlier deduction, so Hal must have discovered his comet in 2011, and Peinope was discovered in 2010. This means Ken Jones discovered Peinope in 2010.
 
 Now, we know:
 - 2008 | Jack Ingram | (unknown comet)
 - 2009 | (unknown astronomer) | Casputi
 - 2010 | Ken Jones | Peinope
 - 2011 | Hal Gregory | (unknown comet)
 
 The only comet left for 2008 is Sporrin, and the only astronomer left for 2009 is Underwood.
 
 Final Answer:
 2008 | Jack Ingram | Sporrin
 2009 | Underwood | Casputi
 2010 | Ken Jones | Peinope
 2011 | Hal Gregory | Crecci","Step-by-step solution:

1. From clue 1, we know that Casputi was discovered in 2009.
   - 2009 | ? | Casputi

2. From clue 2, Jack Ingram discovered a comet in 2008.
   - 2008 | Jack Ingram | ?

3. From clue 3, Underwood discovered a comet 2 years after Jack Ingram. Since Jack discovered a comet in 2008, Underwood discovered a comet in 2010.
   - 2010 | Underwood | ?

4. From clue 4, Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. We need to find when Hal discovered a comet to use this clue.

5. From clue 5, the comet discovered in 2010 is either the one Ken Jones discovered or Crecci. Since Underwood discovered the comet in 2010, it must be Crecci (as Ken Jones did not discover the comet in 2010).
   - 2010 | Underwood | Crecci

6. Now, we know that Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. Since 2010 and 2009 are taken, and Peinope cannot be in 2011 (as it would imply Hal discovered a comet in 2012, which is outside the given years), Peinope must have been discovered in 2008.
   - 2008 | Jack Ingram | Peinope

342.json,"Bushnell County is putting together a historical brochure about some of the ancient cultures that used to live there. Using only the clues below, match the years to the options from cultures and populations. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

years : 100 AD, 350 AD, 600 AD, 850 AD.
cultures : Budel, Hatgare, Oiracha, Sameos.
populations : 4,500, 5,000, 7,500, 9,500.

Clues:
1. The Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD and the culture with 4,500 people were all different cultures.
2. The culture with 9,500 people was founded sometime before the culture with 4,500 people.
3. Of the culture with 4,500 people and the culture with 9,500 people, one was the Budel culture and the other was founded in 600 AD.
4. The culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
100 AD | correct option from cultures | correct option from populations
350 AD | correct option from cultures | correct option from populations
600 AD | correct option from cultures | correct option from populations
850 AD | correct option from cultures | correct option from populations
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, the Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people are all different. This means Oiracha is not founded in 850 AD and does not have a population of 4,500.
 
 2. From Clue 2, the culture with 9,500 people was founded before the culture with 4,500 people. This means the culture with 9,500 people must be either in 100 AD or 350 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people must be either in 600 AD or 850 AD.
 
 3. From Clue 3, one of the cultures with 4,500 people or 9,500 people is Budel, and the other was founded in 600 AD. Since the culture with 9,500 people was founded before the culture with 4,500 people (from Clue 2), the culture with 9,500 people cannot be in 600 AD. Therefore, the culture with 4,500 people is in 600 AD.
 
 4. From Clue 3 and the above deductions, Budel is either the culture with 4,500 people or 9,500 people. Since the culture with 4,500 people is in 600 AD, Budel must be the culture with 9,500 people or 4,500 people. Since Budel cannot be in 600 AD (as it would contradict the culture with 4,500 people being in 600 AD), Budel must be the culture with 9,500 people.
 
 5. From Clue 4, the culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people. If Budel (9,500 people) is in 100 AD, then the culture with 5,000 people must be in 350 AD.
 
 6. From Clue 5, the Sameos culture was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people. Since the culture with 5,000 people is in 350 AD, the culture with 7,500 people must be in 600 AD. This means the culture with 4,500 people is in 850 AD.
 
 7. From Clue 1, since Oiracha is different from the culture founded in 850 AD and the culture with 4,500 people, Oiracha must be in 350 AD.
 
 8. The remaining culture, Hatgare, must be in 100 AD.
 
 Final Answer:
 100 AD | Hatgare | 9,500
 350 AD | Oiracha | 5,000
 600 AD | Sameos | 7,500
 850 AD | Budel | 4,500","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people are all different cultures.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Sameos culture was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people.
- This means Sameos was founded in 100 AD (since 350 AD + 250 years = 600 AD, and 600 AD is the only option left for 7,500 people).

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- The culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people.
- Since Sameos (100 AD) is not 5,000 people (as it is 250 years before 7,500 people), and 850 AD is a different culture from 4,500 people (from Clue 1), the only options left for 5,000 people are 350 AD or 600 AD. Since 600 AD is taken by 7,500 people, 350 AD must be 5,000 people.
- Therefore, 850 AD must be 9,500 people.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the culture with 4,500 people and the culture with 9,500 people, one was the Budel culture and the other was founded in 600 AD.
- Since 600 AD is taken by 7,500 people, 600 AD cannot be 4,500 or 9,500 people. Thus, 4,500 people must be Budel, and it must be at 100 AD (since 350 AD is 5,000 people and 850 AD is 9,500 people).

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 2**
- The culture with 9,500 people was founded sometime before the culture with 4,500 people.
- This confirms that 850 AD (9,500 people) is before 100 AD (4,500 people), which fits as 850 AD is indeed before 100 AD in the next cycle of counting.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Cultures**
- Cultures left are Hatgare and Oiracha. Since Oiracha is different from 850 AD and 4,500 people (Clue 1), and 850 AD is 9,500 people, Oiracha must be 350 AD (5,000 people).
- Hatgare must then be 600 AD (7,500 people).

Fill the following table to show your final answer.

| Year | Culture  | Population |

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, we know that Casputi was discovered in 2009. This gives us one part of the table filled:
  2009 | ? | Casputi
 
 2. From Clue 1, since Casputi was discovered in 2009, Wally Six must be the comet Tillman discovered. This gives us:
  ? | Tillman | Wally Six
 
 3. From Clue 2, since Casputi was discovered in 2009 and not 2008, Trosny must be the comet discovered in 2008. Also, since Casputi was discovered by someone other than Hal Gregory (as it was discovered in 2009), Hal Gregory must have discovered Trosny. This gives us:
  2008 | Hal Gregory | Trosny
 
 4. From Clue 4, since Wally Six is the comet Tillman discovered and not the one discovered in 2008 or 2010, it must be the comet discovered in 2011. Also, since Trosny was discovered in 2008, the comet discovered in 2010 must have been discovered by Jack Ingram. This gives us:
  2010 | Jack Ingram | ?
 
 5. The only remaining year for Wally Six is 2011, and the only remaining comet for Jack Ingram (2010) is Klionne. This gives us:
  2011 | Tillman | Wally Six
  2010 | Jack Ingram | Klionne
 
 6. The only remaining astronomer for 2009 (Casputi) is Ken Jones, as Hal Gregory discovered Trosny in 2008, Jack Ingram discovered Klionne in 2010, and Tillman discovered Wally Six in 2011. This gives us:
  2009 | Ken Jones | Casputi
 
 Final Answer:
 2008 | Hal Gregory | Trosny
 2009 | Ken Jones | Casputi
 2010 | Jack Ingram | Klionne
 2011 | Tillman | Wally Six","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**
- The comet discovered in 2009 is Casputi.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Wally Six is either the comet Tillman discovered or the comet discovered in 2009.
- Since Casputi was discovered in 2009 (from Step 1), Wally Six cannot be the comet discovered in 2009.
- Therefore, Wally Six must be the comet Tillman discovered.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of Trosny and Casputi, one was found in 2008 and the other was first seen by Hal Gregory.
- Since Casputi was discovered in 2009 (from Step 1), Trosny must be the comet found in 2008.
- Therefore, Hal Gregory must have discovered Casputi.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the comet discovered in 2010 and the one discovered in 2008, one is Wally Six and the other was first seen by Jack Ingram.
- Since Trosny was discovered in 2008 (from Step 3) and Wally Six was discovered by Tillman (from Step 2), Jack Ingram must have discovered the comet in 2010.
- Since Wally Six is not the comet discovered in 2008 or 2010, it must be the comet discovered in 2011 by Tillman.

**Step 5: Determine Remaining Comet and Astronomer**
- The remaining comet not yet assigned is Klionne.
- The remaining astronomer not yet assigned is Ken Jones.
- Since 2010 is the year Jack Ingram discovered a comet and Wally Six and Casputi are already assigned to other years, the comet discovered by Jack Ingram in 2010 must be Klionne.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Year**
- Ken Jones must be the astronomer for the remaining year, which is 2011.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 5, we know that Lyle Lucas started in 2007. We need to determine his superhero identity.
 2. From clue 3, ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino. We need to find out which year he started.
 3. From clue 4, either ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) or Peter Powers started in 2009 and the other in 2010. 
 4. From clue 2, the hero who started in 2009 is either ""Criminal Bane"" or Peter Powers. Since ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino, Peter Powers cannot be ""Ultra Hex"". Therefore, Peter Powers must have started in 2010, and ""Criminal Bane"" or ""Ultra Hex"" started in 2009.
 5. Since ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino and he started either in 2009 or 2010, and Peter Powers started in 2010, ""Ultra Hex"" must have started in 2009.
 6. From clue 1, ""Green Avenger"" began 1 year before Peter Powers. Since Peter Powers started in 2010, ""Green Avenger"" started in 2009. But since ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) started in 2009, ""Green Avenger"" must have started in 2008.
 7. The only remaining year for ""Criminal Bane"" is 2010, and the only remaining superhero for Lyle Lucas (who started in 2007) is Max Fusion.
 
 Final Answer:
 2007 | Max Fusion | Lyle Lucas
 2008 | Green Avenger | Hal Houston
 2009 | Ultra Hex | Tim Trevino
 2010 | Criminal Bane | Peter Powers","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 5
- The person who started in 2007 is Lyle Lucas.
  This directly places Lyle Lucas in 2007.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino.
  This directly links the superhero Ultra Hex to the real name Tim Trevino.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
- Of ""Ultra Hex"" and Peter Powers, one began his crusade in 2009 and the other in 2010.
  Since Ultra Hex is Tim Trevino, we can pair these years with either Tim Trevino or Peter Powers.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The hero who started in 2009 is either ""Criminal Bane"" or Peter Powers.
  Since Peter Powers is one of the options for 2009 or 2010 from Clue 4, and he is linked with either 2009 or 2010, we can confirm that Peter Powers started in 2009 or 2010, and the other option, ""Criminal Bane,"" must be the other year if not chosen for Peter Powers.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 1
- ""Green Avenger"" began 1 year before Peter Powers.
  If Peter Powers started in 2009, then Green Avenger must have started in 2008. If Peter Powers started in 2010, then Green Avenger must have started in 2009. Since Peter Powers or ""Criminal Bane"" must be in 2009 (from Clue 2), and ""Green Avenger"" cannot be in 2009 (as it would contradict Clue 1 with Peter Powers starting in 2010), it confirms that Peter Powers started in 2009 and Green Avenger in 2008.

Step 6: Assign Remaining Options
- From the above steps, we know:
  - 2007: Lyle Lucas
  - 2008: Green Avenger
  - 2009: Peter Powers
  - 2010: Ultra Hex (Tim Trevino)
  Since ""Criminal Bane"" is not Peter Powers and Peter Powers is in 2009, ""Criminal Bane"" must be in 2010. But since Ultra Hex (Tim Trevino) is confirmed for 2010, ""Criminal Bane"" must be in 2008, and Max Fusion must be in 2007.

Final Answer:
2007 | Max Fusion | Lyle Lucas

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, we know Grosmolen was built in 1729.
 2. From Clue 3, we know Vlietmolen was built in 1706.
 3. From Clue 1, since Grosmolen was built in 1729, it must be owned by the De Vries family (since the other option for 1729 is Doesmolen, which must then be the one built in 1683).
 4. Now, we know:
  - 1683 | Doesmolen | (unknown family)
  - 1706 | Vlietmolen | (unknown family)
  - 1729 | Grosmolen | De Vries
  - 1752 | (unknown windmill) | (unknown family)
 5. From Clue 4, the Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill. This means the only possible years for Meijer and Bakker are 1706 and 1729, or 1729 and 1752. Since Grosmolen in 1729 is owned by De Vries, Meijer must be in 1706 and Bakker in 1729.
 6. Now, we know:
  - 1683 | Doesmolen | (unknown family)
  - 1706 | Vlietmolen | Meijer
  - 1729 | Grosmolen | De Vries
  - 1752 | (unknown windmill) | Bakker

 Final Answer:
 1683 | Doesmolen | Van Dijk
 1706 | Vlietmolen | Meijer
 1729 | Grosmolen | De Vries
 1752 | Zemelmolen | Bakker","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign known years to windmills based on clues 2 and 3.**
- Grosmolen was built in 1729.
- Vlietmolen was built in 1706.

**Step 2: Analyze clue 1.**
- Of the windmill built in 1729 and the windmill built in 1683, one is owned by the De Vries family and the other is Doesmolen.
- Since Grosmolen was built in 1729, it must either be owned by the De Vries family or be Doesmolen. However, since Grosmolen is already identified as a windmill, it cannot be Doesmolen. Therefore, Grosmolen is owned by the De Vries family.
- Doesmolen was built in 1683.

**Step 3: Determine the remaining windmill and year.**
- The remaining windmills are Zemelmolen.
- The remaining years are 1752.
- Therefore, Zemelmolen was built in 1752.

**Step 4: Use clue 4 to determine the relationship between the Bakker and Meijer families.**
- The Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill.
- Since we know the years 1683, 1706, 1729, and 1752, the only possible 23-year gap is between 1729 and 1752.
- Therefore, the Meijer family's windmill was built in 1729, and the Bakker family's windmill was built in 1752.

**Step 5: Assign families to the remaining windmills.**
- Meijer family is associated with Grosmolen (1729).
- Bakker family is associated with Zemelmolen (1752).
- The remaining family, Van Dijk, must be associated with Vlietmolen (1706).

 Step 4: From Clue 1, since one of the Laneplex or Streeter Inc. interviews is on August 22nd and the other is for the copywriter job, and we know Streeter Inc. is on August 23rd, Laneplex must be on August 22nd and Streeter Inc. must be the copywriter job.
 
 Step 5: From Clue 3, the web developer position interview is before the Laneplex interview. Since Laneplex is on August 22nd, and the only days before August 22nd are August 20th and August 21st, and August 21st is already taken by the social media position, the web developer position must be on August 20th with Sancode.
 
 Step 6: The remaining company for August 21st is Haytouch, and the remaining position for August 22nd is tech support.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 August 20th | Sancode | web developer
 August 21st | Haytouch | social media
 August 22nd | Laneplex | tech support
 August 23rd | Streeter Inc. | copywriter","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 5
- The Streeter Inc. interview is on August 23rd.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- The Streeter Inc. interview is 2 days after the interview for the social media position.
- Since Streeter Inc. is on August 23rd, the social media position interview must be on August 21st.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
- The Sancode interview is on August 20th.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 1
- Of the Laneplex interview and the Streeter Inc. interview, one is on August 22nd and the other is for the copywriter job.
- Since Streeter Inc. is on August 23rd, Laneplex must be on August 22nd.
- Therefore, the copywriter job is associated with Streeter Inc. on August 23rd.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 3
- The meeting for the web developer position is sometime before the Laneplex interview.
- Laneplex interview is on August 22nd, so the web developer position must be on August 20th or August 21st.
- Since August 21st is already taken by the social media position, the web developer position must be on August 20th.

Step 6: Assign remaining positions and companies
- August 20th is Sancode and web developer.
- August 21st is social media, but the company is not yet determined.
- August 22nd is Laneplex, but the position is not yet determined.

Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

orders : first, second, third, fourth.
names : Carmen, Lora, Nick, Wesley.
items : balls, batons, bowling pins, flashlights.

Clues:
1. The person who went third was either Nick or the juggler who used flashlights.
2. Nick went first.
3. The performer who used batons performed 1 spot after the person who used flashlights.
4. Of Nick and Carmen, one went second and the other used balls.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
first | correct option from names | correct option from items
second | correct option from names | correct option from items
third | correct option from names | correct option from items
fourth | correct option from names | correct option from items
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, Nick went first. This is our starting point.
 2. From Clue 1, since Nick went first, the person who went third must be the juggler who used flashlights.
 3. From Clue 5, the performer who used flashlights was either Lora or Carmen. Since the third performer used flashlights, it must be either Lora or Carmen.
 4. From Clue 3, the performer who used batons performed 1 spot after the person who used flashlights. Since flashlights were used in the third position, batons were used in the fourth position.
 5. From Clue 4, of Nick and Carmen, one went second and the other used balls. Since Nick went first, Carmen did not go second. Therefore, Carmen used balls.
 6. Since Carmen used balls and the only positions left for Carmen are third or fourth, and since the third position used flashlights, Carmen must be in the fourth position using balls.
 7. Since Carmen is fourth with balls, and the third position used flashlights, the third position must be Lora (as per Clue 5).
 8. The second position is the only one left for the remaining name, which is Wesley.
 9. The only remaining item not assigned is bowling pins, which must be used by Wesley in the second position.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 first | Nick | (unknown item)
 second | Wesley | bowling pins
 third | Lora | flashlights
 fourth | Carmen | balls
 
 To determine the item Nick used, we know it can't be flashlights, balls, or bowling pins (used by others). The only item left is batons, which contradicts Clue 3. Therefore, Nick must have used the remaining item not listed in the clues, which is an error in our initial assumption. Revisiting the clues, we realize that Nick must have used the only item left unassigned correctly, which is not batons but rather the only item left, which is balls. This means Carmen must have used another item, which is batons, as it's the only one left.
 
 Corrected Final Answer:
 first | Nick | balls
 second | Wesley | bowling pins
 third | Lora | flashlights
 fourth | Carmen | batons","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Nick went first.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person who went third was either Nick or the juggler who used flashlights.
- Since Nick went first, the person who went third used flashlights.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- The performer who used flashlights was either Lora or Carmen.
- Since the person who went third used flashlights, this person must be either Lora or Carmen.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 3**
- The performer who used batons performed 1 spot after the person who used flashlights.
- Since the person who used flashlights went third, the person who used batons went fourth.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of Nick and Carmen, one went second and the other used balls.
- Since Nick went first, Carmen did not go second. Therefore, Carmen used balls.
- Since Carmen used balls, she did not use flashlights, so Lora went third and used flashlights.

**Step 6: Determine Remaining Positions and Items**
- Nick went first and Carmen used balls, but we need to determine what Nick used.
- Carmen did not go second, so the remaining person for the second position is not yet determined.
- Since Carmen used balls and Lora used flashlights, and the fourth person used batons, the remaining item for Nick (first) is bowling pins.

**Step 7: Determine Second Position**
- Remaining names are Wesley and Carmen, and Carmen is already assigned balls.
- Remaining items for the second position are balls, but since Carmen used balls and she didn't go second, Wesley went second and used balls.

**Step 8: Finalize**
- Nick went first with bowling pins.
- Wesley went second with balls.
- Lora went third with flashlights.
- The only remaining person and item for the fourth position are Carmen and batons.

342.json,"Megan is setting up an exhibit at the National Museum of Fiji about the discovery of several small South Sea islands. Using only the clues below, match the years to the options from islands and cultures. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

years : 1754, 1761, 1768, 1775.
islands : Fushil, Jujihm, Teuz, Zafet.
cultures : Hakili, Holo'oka, Manika'i, Kukani.

Clues:
1. The island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Jujihm or Teuz.
2. Of the island on which the Holo'oka people lived and the island discovered in 1761, one was Fushil and the other was Teuz.
3. The island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived.
4. Fushil was discovered sometime before Teuz.
5. The island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1754 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1761 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1768 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1775 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, we know that the island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Fushil or Teuz, and one of these islands was discovered in 1761. From Clue 4, Fushil was discovered before Teuz. Therefore, Fushil was discovered in 1761 and Teuz was discovered later.
 
 2. From Clue 1, the Holo'oka people lived on either Jujihm or Teuz. Since Teuz was discovered later than 1761 and Fushil was discovered in 1761, the Holo'oka people must have lived on Teuz.
 
 3. From Clue 5, the island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm. This means Jujihm was discovered after the island of the Hakili people.
 
 4. From Clue 3, the island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered after the island on which the Manika'i people lived. Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and Teuz was discovered later, and since the Hakili people lived on an island discovered before Jujihm, the only option left for the Hakili people is 1761, and Jujihm must be 1768.
 
 5. Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and the Hakili people lived on the island discovered 7 years before Jujihm (1768 - 7 = 1761), the Hakili people lived on Fushil.
 
 6. The Manika'i people must have lived on an island discovered before 1761 (since the Hakili people lived on an island discovered after the Manika'i people). The only year before 1761 is 1754. The only island left for 1754 is Zafet.
 
 7. The only remaining island for 1775 is Jujihm, and the only remaining culture is Kukani.
 
 Final Answer:
 1754 | Zafet | Manika'i
 1761 | Fushil | Hakili
 1768 | Jujihm | Holo'oka
 1775 | Teuz | Kukani","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5**
- Clue 4 states that Fushil was discovered sometime before Teuz.
- Clue 5 states that the island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm.

**Step 2: Deduce from Clue 1 and Clue 2**
- Clue 1 states that the island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Jujihm or Teuz.
- Clue 2 states that of the island on which the Holo'oka people lived and the island discovered in 1761, one was Fushil and the other was Teuz.

From Clue 2, since one of the islands is Fushil and the other is Teuz, and from Clue 1, since Holo'oka lived on either Jujihm or Teuz, it implies that Holo'oka lived on Teuz. Therefore, Teuz cannot be the island discovered in 1761, so Fushil was discovered in 1761.

**Step 3: Apply Clue 4**
- Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and Fushil was discovered before Teuz, Teuz must be discovered after 1761. The possible years for Teuz are 1768 or 1775.

**Step 4: Apply Clue 5**
- Since Hakili lived on an island discovered 7 years before Jujihm, we need to find the years that are 7 years apart. The possible pairs are (1754, 1761) and (1768, 1775). Since Fushil was discovered in 1761, Jujihm cannot be discovered in 1761. Therefore, if Hakili lived on an island discovered in 1768, Jujihm would be discovered in 1775.

**Step 5: Deduce Remaining Islands and Cultures**
- Since Hakili lived on the island discovered in 1768, and Fushil was discovered in 1761 with Holo'oka on Teuz, the remaining island for 1754 is Zafet.
- The remaining culture for Zafet in 1754 is Manika'i (from Clue 3, Hakili lived after Manika'i).

**Step 6: Assign the Remaining Culture to Fushil**
- The remaining culture for Fushil in 1761 is Kukani.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
- 1754 | Zafet | Manika'i
- 1761 | Fushil | Kukani
- 1768 | Jujihm | Hakili
- 1775 | Teuz | Holo'oka

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 1, Gene paid $7.75.
 2. From clue 4, Rosa asked for chia seeds.
 3. From clue 2, Rosa paid $1 more than the person who requested ginger. Since Rosa paid more than the person with ginger, and the only prices higher than $7.75 are $8.75 and $9.75, Rosa must have paid either of these. Since Rosa paid $1 more than the person with ginger, the person with ginger must have paid either $7.75 or $8.75. Since Gene paid $7.75 and didn't get ginger (as per the prices), the person with ginger must have paid $8.75, and thus Rosa paid $9.75.
 4. From clue 3, the person who requested acai berries and the customer who requested ginger, one paid $8.75 and the other is Delores. Since the person with ginger paid $8.75, Delores did not request ginger. Therefore, Delores must have requested acai berries and paid a different amount. The only remaining prices are $6.75 and $8.75. Since ginger is $8.75, Delores must have paid $6.75.
 5. The remaining customer is Betsy, and the remaining superfood is kale. The only remaining price is $8.75, which is already taken by ginger. Therefore, Betsy must have paid the remaining price, which is $7.75, but since Gene already paid $7.75, Betsy must pay the remaining price which is $8.75.
 
 Final Answer:
 $6.75 | Delores | acai berries
 $7.75 | Gene | kale
 $8.75 | Betsy | ginger
 $9.75 | Rosa | chia seeds","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Assign known values from clues.
From clue 1, Gene paid $7.75.
From clue 4, Rosa asked for chia seeds.

Step 2: Analyze clue 2.
Rosa paid 1 dollar more than the person who requested ginger. Since Rosa paid $1 more than the person with ginger, and the prices are $6.75, $7.75, $8.75, $9.75, Rosa must have paid either $7.75 or $8.75 or $9.75. Since Gene paid $7.75, Rosa did not pay $7.75. Therefore, Rosa paid either $8.75 or $9.75.

Step 3: Analyze clue 3.
Of the person who requested acai berries and the customer who requested ginger, one paid $8.75 and the other is Delores. Since Rosa paid more than the person with ginger, the person with ginger must have paid $8.75 or less. Since Gene paid $7.75 and is not associated with ginger (from the given clues), the person with ginger must have paid $6.75 or $8.75. Since one of them is Delores and Delores cannot be Rosa (who had chia seeds), Delores must be the one who requested either acai berries or ginger.

Step 4: Determine Rosa's exact payment.
Since Rosa paid $1 more than the person with ginger and the person with ginger could only have paid $6.75 or $8.75, and since Rosa must pay more than $7.75 (Gene's payment), Rosa must have paid $9.75. Therefore, the person with ginger paid $8.75.

Step 5: Assign Delores.
Since Delores is either the one who requested acai berries or ginger, and the person with ginger paid $8.75, Delores must be the one who requested ginger.

Step 6: Assign remaining prices and superfoods.
Gene paid $7.75, and the remaining superfoods for him are acai berries or kale. Since Delores requested ginger and Rosa requested chia seeds, the remaining superfood for Gene is kale (since acai berries and ginger are taken by Delores). Betsy, the remaining customer, must have requested acai berries and paid $6.75.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$6.75 | Betsy | acai berries

Step 1: Analyze the given clues.
- Clue 3 states that the interview on August 21st is for the web developer job.
- Clue 2 states that the interview on August 23rd is for the tech support job.

Step 2: Apply Clue 1.
- The Streeter Inc. interview is 2 days after the Canway interview. This means if Canway is on August 20th, then Streeter Inc. must be on August 22nd. If Canway is on August 21st, then Streeter Inc. would be on August 23rd, but since August 23rd is for tech support, this is not possible. Therefore, Canway is on August 20th and Streeter Inc. is on August 22nd.

Step 3: Apply Clue 4.
- The interview on August 23rd is at Laneplex or for the sales rep job. Since August 23rd is already assigned to tech support, it must be at Laneplex. Therefore, the sales rep job is on August 20th.

Step 4: Assign remaining company and position.
- Companies left: Zathdrill
- Positions left: graphic design, sales rep (already assigned to August 20th)
- Since August 20th is Canway and sales rep, August 21st is web developer, August 22nd is Streeter Inc., and August 23rd is Laneplex and tech support, the remaining company Zathdrill must be on August 21st with the web developer position.

512 GB | correct option from customers | correct option from ram
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's computer. This means Victor's computer must have a hard drive of either 384 GB or 512 GB.
 
 2. From Clue 4, the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM. This means if the 1 GB RAM computer has a 128 GB hard drive, then the 4 GB RAM computer must have a 384 GB hard drive.
 
 3. From Clue 5, the computer with 256 GB of hard drive space is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM. Since we know from Clue 2 that the computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive smaller than Alejandro's, and Alejandro's must be larger than 256 GB, it means Otis must have the 256 GB hard drive.
 
 4. From Clue 1, Jack's computer is either the system with 256 GB of hard drive space or the build with 4 GB of RAM. Since Otis has the 256 GB hard drive, Jack must have the 4 GB of RAM and thus the 384 GB hard drive.
 
 5. From Clue 2, the computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive smaller than Alejandro's. Since Alejandro's is larger than 256 GB and Jack has the 384 GB, Alejandro must have the 512 GB hard drive. This leaves the 12 GB RAM computer with the 128 GB hard drive.
 
 6. From Clue 3, Victor's computer must be 256 GB larger than the 1 GB RAM computer. Since the 1 GB RAM computer has a 128 GB hard drive, Victor's must be 384 GB. But since Jack already has the 384 GB hard drive, Victor must have the 512 GB hard drive, and Alejandro must have the 128 GB hard drive.
 
 7. This leaves the 1 GB RAM computer with the 128 GB hard drive, and the 3 GB RAM computer with the 256 GB hard drive.
 
 Final Answer:
 128 GB | Alejandro | 12 GB
 256 GB | Otis | 3 GB
 384 GB | Jack | 4 GB
 512 GB | Victor | 1 GB","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**
- The computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's computer.
- This implies that Victor's computer must have a hard drive larger than the smallest available, which is 128 GB. Therefore, Victor cannot have the 128 GB hard drive.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4**
- The computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM.
- Since the smallest increment available is 256 GB, the computer with 1 GB of RAM cannot have the 512 GB hard drive (as there is no 768 GB option).

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- The computer with 256 GB of hard drive space is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM.
- This means Otis does not have the 128 GB, 384 GB, or 512 GB hard drives.

**Step 4: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 4**
- If the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's, and the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM, we can start placing possible values:
  - If 1 GB of RAM has 128 GB, then 4 GB of RAM has 384 GB (128 + 256).
  - Victor must then have either 384 GB or 512 GB.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clue 2**
- The computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is somewhat smaller than Alejandro's build.
- Since 12 GB of RAM cannot have the smallest hard drive (128 GB), and it is smaller than Alejandro's, Alejandro must have one of the larger drives.

**Step 6: Deduce from Clue 1**
- Jack's computer is either the system with 256 GB of hard drive space or the build with 4 GB of RAM.
- Since we know the computer with 4 GB of RAM has 384 GB, Jack must have either 256 GB or 384 GB.

**Step 7: Final Placement**
- Since the computer with 256 GB is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM, and Jack's computer is either 256 GB or 384 GB, Jack must have 384 GB with 4 GB of RAM.
- Otis then has 256 GB with 12 GB of RAM.
- Victor cannot have 128 GB, so he must have 512 GB.
- Alejandro then has 128 GB.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
April 13th | correct option from names | correct option from careers
May 18th | correct option from names | correct option from careers
June 14th | correct option from names | correct option from careers
July 16th | correct option from names | correct option from careers
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, we know Harry is the musician.
 2. From Clue 2, Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's. Since Harry is a musician, his career is not dependent on the surgeon or architect's timeline.
 3. From Clue 3, Adrian's birthday is 1 month after the surgeon's.
 4. From Clue 4, the architect's birthday is 2 months after the surgeon's.
 
 Let's assign the birthdays:
 - Since Harry is the musician and Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's, we need to find a pair of months that are one month apart. The possible pairs are April-May, May-June, and June-July.
 
 Let's try Harry in June (June 14th) as the musician:
 - Dale would then be in July (July 16th).
 
 Now, we need to place the surgeon, Adrian, and the architect:
 - Adrian is 1 month after the surgeon (Clue 3).
 - The architect is 2 months after the surgeon (Clue 4).
 
 If we place the surgeon in April (April 13th):
 - Adrian would be in May (May 18th) (1 month after April).
 - The architect would be in June (June 14th) (2 months after April).
 
 However, Harry is already placed in June as the musician. This conflict means the surgeon cannot be in April. Let's try another arrangement.
 
 If we place the surgeon in May (May 18th):
 - Adrian would be in June (June 14th) (1 month after May).
 - The architect would be in July (July 16th) (2 months after May).
 
 This arrangement fits without conflicts:
 - Harry is the musician in June.
 - Dale is in July, 1 month after Harry.
 - Adrian is in June, 1 month after the surgeon in May.
 - The architect is in July, 2 months after the surgeon in May.
 
 Since all careers are assigned except for the lawyer, Lamar must be the lawyer, and his birthday must be the remaining unassigned date, which is April 13th.
 
 Final Answer:
 April 13th | Lamar | lawyer
 May 18th | surgeon | surgeon
 June 14th | Adrian | musician
 July 16th | Dale | architect","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Harry is the musician.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Dale has a birthday 1 month after Harry.
- Since we don't know Harry's birthday yet, we can't determine Dale's birthday directly. We need to keep this relationship in mind.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Adrian has a birthday 1 month after the surgeon.
- This clue also depends on knowing the surgeon's birthday, which we don't know yet.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The architect has a birthday 2 months after the surgeon.
- This clue also depends on the surgeon's birthday.

**Step 5: Deduce the surgeon's birthday**
- Since the architect's birthday is 2 months after the surgeon and Adrian's birthday is 1 month after the surgeon, the surgeon must have one of the earlier birthdays to allow for these intervals.
- Possible birthdays for the surgeon are April 13th or May 18th. If the surgeon's birthday is April 13th, then Adrian's birthday would be May 18th, and the architect's birthday would be June 14th. This setup allows Dale to be July 16th, which is 1 month after Harry's June 14th birthday.

**Step 6: Assign careers based on birthdays**
- If the surgeon is April 13th, Adrian (May 18th) and the architect (June 14th) follow logically. Dale's birthday would then be July 16th, which fits the clue that Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's.

**Step 7: Assign remaining names and careers**
- Harry is the musician, and if his birthday is June 14th, then Dale's birthday being July 16th fits.
- The remaining career for April 13th (surgeon) would be Lamar, as all other names and careers are assigned logically.

### Final Answer:
- Fill the following table to show your final answer.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, the alligator that is 14.0 feet long is either the 20-year-old alligator or Arthur. We can't decide yet, so we'll keep this in mind.
 
 2. From Clue 2, the alligator that is 11.5 feet long is younger than Arthur. This means Arthur cannot be the youngest and is not 11.5 feet long.
 
 3. From Clue 3, the alligator that is 12.0 feet long and Carlos are either 20 years old or 10 years old. We need more information to decide.
 
 4. From Clue 4, the alligator that is 11.5 feet long is 5 years younger than Carlos. Since the only ages 5 years apart are 5 and 10, or 10 and 15, and since the 11.5 feet long alligator is younger, Carlos must be 10 years old and the 11.5 feet long alligator is 5 years old.
 
 5. From Clue 5, Iggy is 10 years younger than the alligator that is 14.0 feet long. Since the 14.0 feet long alligator could be 20 years old (from Clue 1), Iggy must be 10 years old. This confirms Carlos is not 10 years old, so Carlos must be 20 years old and 12.0 feet long (from Clue 3).
 
 6. Since Carlos is 20 years old and 12.0 feet long, and Iggy is 10 years old, the 14.0 feet long alligator must be Arthur and 20 years old (from Clue 1). This leaves Sparky as the remaining name and age, which must be 15 years old.
 
 7. The lengths left are 13.6 feet for Sparky, as the other lengths have been assigned.
 
 Final Answer:
 5 | Iggy | 11.5 feet

 15 | Sparky | 13.6 feet
 20 | Arthur | 14.0 feet","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The alligator that is 14.0 feet long is either the 20-year-old alligator or Arthur.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the animal that is 12.0 feet long and Carlos, one is 20 years old and the other is 10 years old.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- Iggy is 10 years younger than the animal that is 14.0 feet long.
- Since the 14.0 feet long alligator could be 20 years old (from Clue 1), Iggy must be 10 years old.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The alligator that is 11.5 feet long is 5 years younger than Carlos.
- Since Carlos is either 20 or 10 years old (from Clue 3), and the 11.5 feet long alligator is younger, Carlos must be 15 years old and the 11.5 feet long alligator is 10 years old. This contradicts the age of Iggy from Step 3, so Carlos must be 20 years old and the 11.5 feet long alligator is 15 years old.

**Step 5: Re-evaluate Clue 3 with new information**
- Carlos is 20 years old and not 12.0 feet long, so the 12.0 feet long alligator must be 10 years old.

**Step 6: Re-evaluate Clue 1 with new information**
- Since Carlos is 20 years old and not Arthur, Arthur must be the 14.0 feet long alligator.

**Step 7: Determine remaining names and lengths**
- Iggy is 10 years old and 12.0 feet long (from Step 5).
- Carlos is 20 years old, and we know from Clue 2 that the 11.5 feet long alligator is younger than Arthur, so Carlos cannot be 11.5 feet long. Thus, Carlos must be 13.6 feet long.
- Sparky is the remaining name and must be 11.5 feet long and 15 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

5 | - | -
10 | Iggy | 12.0 feet
15 | Sparky | 11.5 feet
20 | Carlos | 13.6 feet

Arthur is 14.0 feet long and 20 years old, but since Carlos is also 20 years old, there seems to be a contradiction. Let's re-evaluate:

- Arthur is 14.0 feet long.
- Carlos is 20 years old and 13.6 feet long.
- Iggy is 10 years old and 12.0 feet long.
- Sparky is 15 years old and 11.5 feet long.

Thus, Arthur must be the remaining age, which is 20 years old, matching the clue that the 14.0 feet long alligator is either 20 years old or Arthur. This resolves the contradiction.

 1. From clue 1, the letter sent in 1962 is from Torquay.
  - 1962 | ? | Torquay
 
 2. From clue 2, George's message was sent in 1969.
  - 1969 | George | ?
 
 3. From clue 3, we know that one of the letters from Brighton or the one sent in 1976 is George's and the other is Karla's. Since George's letter was sent in 1969, Karla's letter must be the one from 1976 or Brighton. Since George's letter is already assigned to 1969, it cannot be from Brighton or 1976. Therefore, Karla's letter must be from Brighton and sent in 1976.
  - 1976 | Karla | Brighton
 
 4. From clue 4, Tracy's message, the bottle sent in 1983, and the message from Penzance are all different. Since 1962 is Torquay, 1976 is Brighton, the only years left for Penzance are 1969 and 1983. Since 1969 is already taken by George, Penzance must be 1983, and Tracy cannot be 1983. Therefore, Tracy's message must be from a different year.

 5. Now, we know:
  - 1962 | ? | Torquay
  - 1969 | George | ?
  - 1976 | Karla | Brighton
  - 1983 | ? | Penzance
 
 6. Since Tracy's message is not from 1983 and Penzance, and Karla's is already assigned, the only years left for Tracy are 1962 or 1969. Since 1969 is taken by George, Tracy must be 1962.
  - 1962 | Tracy | Torquay
 
 7. The only writer left for 1983 is Sean.
  - 1983 | Sean | Penzance
 
 8. The only origin left for 1969 (George's message) is Le Havre.

 1983 | Sean | Penzance","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The letter sent in 1962 was from Torquay.
  - 1962 | ? | Torquay

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- George's message was sent in 1969.
  - 1969 | George | ?

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Of the letter from Brighton and the missive that was sent in 1976, one is George's and the other is Karla's.
  - Since George's message was sent in 1969, Karla's message must be the one sent in 1976.
  - 1976 | Karla | ?
  - Since the only other option for the origin in Clue 3 is Brighton, and George's origin is not yet determined, Brighton cannot be the origin for 1969 or 1976. 

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- Tracy's message, the bottle that was sent in 1983, and the message from Penzance are all different letters.
  - 1983 | Tracy | ?
  - Since Penzance is different from the 1983 message, it cannot be the origin for Tracy's message.

Step 5: Deduce from remaining options
- Origins left: Brighton, Le Havre, Penzance
- Since Penzance is different from 1983 and Tracy, and cannot be for 1976 (Karla, as per Clue 3), it must be for 1969 (George).
  - 1969 | George | Penzance
- Since Brighton cannot be for 1969 or 1976, and Torquay is already assigned to 1962, Brighton must be for 1983.
  - 1983 | Tracy | Brighton
- The only origin left for 1976 is Le Havre.
  - 1976 | Karla | Le Havre

Step 6: Assign remaining writer to 1962
- Writers left: Sean
- Since all other writers are assigned, Sean must be the writer for 1962.

 1. From clue 1, we know that the 9:00am tour starts at Greektown.
 2. From clue 4, we know that Dustin's trip starts at Casa Loma. The time for this is not yet known.
 3. From clue 3, we know that one of the tours at Greektown or High Park starts at 7:00am and one is guided by Janice. Since Greektown is at 9:00am, High Park must be the location at 7:00am. Janice must be the guide for one of these tours. Since 9:00am is already assigned to Greektown, Janice must be the guide for the 9:00am Greektown tour.
 4. From clue 2, Faye's tour starts 1 hour before Kelly's. This means they must be at consecutive times.
 5. Since Janice is at 9:00am and Dustin's location is known but not his time, Dustin cannot be at 8:00am or 10:00am because that would not allow consecutive slots for Faye and Kelly. Therefore, Dustin must be at 7:00am at Casa Loma.
 6. This leaves 8:00am and 10:00am for Faye and Kelly. Since Faye's tour is 1 hour before Kelly's, Faye must be at 8:00am and Kelly at 10:00am.

Step 1: Assign the known facts from the clues.
- From clue 1: The 9:00am tour starts at Greektown.
- From clue 4: Dustin's trip starts at Casa Loma.

Step 2: Analyze the clues involving relationships between times, guides, and locations.
- From clue 2: Faye's outing is 1 hour before Kelly's. This means Faye could be at 7:00am or 8:00am, and Kelly would then be at 8:00am or 9:00am respectively. However, since 9:00am is already taken by the Greektown tour, Faye must be at 7:00am and Kelly at 8:00am.

Step 3: Apply clue 3 to determine the correct assignments for Janice and the 7:00am tour.
- Clue 3 states that one of the tours at Greektown or High Park is with Janice and the other is at 7:00am. Since Greektown is at 9:00am with Janice, the 7:00am tour must be at High Park.

Step 4: Assign the remaining guide and location.
- Since Dustin is at Casa Loma and Janice is at Greektown, and Faye is at 7:00am at High Park, Kelly must be at 8:00am. The only remaining location for 8:00am is Little Italy.
- The only remaining time slot is 10:00am, and the only remaining guide is Kelly. The only remaining location is the one not yet used, which is High Park.

Step 5: Review and confirm all assignments to ensure no conflicts and all clues are satisfied.
- Dustin at Casa Loma (clue 4).

342.json,"The Springfield County Bird Club met today, and several of its members brought their newest acquisitions. Using only the clues below, match the months to the options from names and birds. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

months : January, February, March, April.
names : Alberta, Della, Ellen, Gladys.
birds : finch, lovebird, macaw, parakeet.

Clues:
1. Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
2. The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
3. The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.
4. Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet.
5. The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird.

While answering use the following format:

Your steps showing how you are solving the puzzle
Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
January | correct option from names | correct option from birds
February | correct option from names | correct option from birds
March | correct option from names | correct option from birds
April | correct option from names | correct option from birds
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, we know that one of the birds bought in February and January is the macaw and the other is owned by Gladys. 
 
 2. From Clue 2, the macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet. This means Ellen's pet cannot be in January or February, and the macaw must be in January or February to allow a 2-month gap.
 
 3. From Clue 3, the parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch. This means the finch cannot be in April, and the parakeet cannot be in January.
 
 4. From Clue 4, Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet. This means Alberta's pet cannot be in April, and Gladys's pet cannot be in January.
 
 5. From Clue 5, the finch was bought sometime after the lovebird. This means the lovebird cannot be in April, and the finch cannot be in January.
 
 Using these clues:
 - If the macaw was bought in January (from Clue 2), Ellen's pet would be in March. This fits as the macaw is 2 months before March.
 - If the macaw is in January, then Gladys's pet must be in February (from Clue 1).
 - Since Alberta's pet is 1 month before Gladys's, Alberta's pet must be in January (from Clue 4).
 - This means Ellen's pet is in March, and the only remaining month for Della is April.
 
 Now, assigning birds:
 - Since the macaw is in January, and the finch is after the lovebird (from Clue 5), and the parakeet is 1 month after the finch (from Clue 3), the only arrangement that fits is:
  - Lovebird in February, Finch in March, Parakeet in April.
 
 Final Answer:
 January | Alberta | Macaw
 February | Gladys | Lovebird
 March | Ellen | Finch
 April | Della | Parakeet","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
- This means Ellen did not buy her pet in January or February, and the macaw must have been bought in January or February.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
- From Step 1, if the macaw was bought in January, then Gladys's pet was bought in February, or vice versa.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet.
- If Gladys's pet was in February, Alberta's pet must be in January. If Gladys's pet was in January, Alberta's pet must be in December (which is not possible as per the given months). Therefore, Gladys's pet is in February and Alberta's pet is in January.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 3**
- The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.
- Since January and February are occupied by Alberta and Gladys, the finch and parakeet must be in March and April respectively.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird.
- Since the finch is in March, the lovebird must be in February.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Birds**
- Alberta's pet in January cannot be the macaw (as it's either in January or February and Gladys or the macaw is in February). Since the lovebird is in February, Alberta must have the remaining bird which is not the finch or lovebird. Therefore, Alberta has the macaw in January.
- Gladys has the lovebird in February.
- Ellen, by elimination and Clue 2, must have the parakeet in April.

**Step 7: Assign Remaining Name**
- Della is the only name left, so she must have the finch in March.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. Start with Clue 4: Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall.
  - 147 ft. | Zeke's Spruce | ?
 
 2. Analyze Clue 1: Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94 year-old tree.
  - This means the 94 year-old tree must be either 144 ft. or 150 ft. tall, as Marsh Tree must be either 147 ft. or 153 ft. tall. Since Zeke's Spruce is already 147 ft., Marsh Tree must be 153 ft. tall, and the 94 year-old tree is 150 ft. tall.
  - 150 ft. | ? | 94
  - 153 ft. | Marsh Tree | ?
 
 3. Use Clue 2: Of The Senator and Marsh Tree, one is 85 years old and the other is 153 ft. tall.
  - Since Marsh Tree is 153 ft. tall, The Senator must be 85 years old.
  - 153 ft. | Marsh Tree | 85
 
 4. Use Clue 3: The Senator is taller than the 96 year-old tree.
  - Since The Senator is 85 years old, the 96 year-old tree must be shorter than 153 ft. The only heights left are 144 ft. and 150 ft. Since 150 ft. is already taken by the 94 year-old tree, the 96 year-old tree must be 144 ft. tall.
  - 144 ft. | ? | 96
 
 5. Assign remaining tree and age:
  - The only tree left is Evan's Fir and the only age left is 94 years. Since 150 ft. is the height of the 94 year-old tree, Evan's Fir must be 150 ft. tall.
  - 150 ft. | Evan's Fir | 94
 
 6. Assign remaining tree and age for 144 ft.:
  - The only tree left is The Senator and the only age left is 96 years.
  - 144 ft. | The Senator | 96
 
 Final Answer:
 144 ft. | The Senator | 96
 147 ft. | Zeke's Spruce | 85
 150 ft. | Evan's Fir | 94
 153 ft. | Marsh Tree | 85","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94 year-old tree.
- Since heights are 144 ft., 147 ft., 150 ft., 153 ft., and Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than another tree, the 94 year-old tree cannot be 153 ft. tall (as there is no 156 ft. option). Therefore, the 94 year-old tree must be 147 ft. or less.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of The Senator and Marsh Tree, one is 85 years old and the other is 153 ft. tall.
- Since Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94 year-old tree, it cannot be 94 years old. Therefore, Marsh Tree must be 153 ft. tall or 85 years old.

**Step 4: Combine Clues 1 and 3**
- The Senator is taller than the 96 year-old tree.
- Since The Senator is either 85 years old or 153 ft. tall, and Marsh Tree is 153 ft. tall, The Senator must be 85 years old.
- Since The Senator is taller than the 96 year-old tree, the 96 year-old tree must be shorter than 153 ft. The only options left for the 96 year-old tree are 144 ft. and 150 ft.

**Step 5: Deduce from remaining options**
- Since Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall, and Marsh Tree is 153 ft. tall, the remaining heights for the 96 year-old tree are 144 ft. and 150 ft.
- Since The Senator is 85 years old and taller than the 96 year-old tree, the 96 year-old tree must be 144 ft. tall.
- The only remaining tree is Evan's Fir, and the only remaining height and age are 150 ft. and 94 years old.

342.json,"Bill is shopping for a digital camera. Using only the clues below, match the prices to the options from companies and cameras. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

prices : $550, $575, $600, $625.
companies : Banion, Cober, Dayero, Honwa.
cameras : DM-5000, FC-520, G-290, Tela G5.

Clues:
1. The camera made by Banion costs 25 dollars more than the DM-5000.
2. Of the camera made by Honwa and the camera made by Banion, one is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550.
3. The FC-520 costs 50 dollars more than the model made by Cober.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$550 | correct option from companies | correct option from cameras
$575 | correct option from companies | correct option from cameras
$600 | correct option from companies | correct option from cameras
$625 | correct option from companies | correct option from cameras
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
 - It states that one of the cameras made by Banion or Honwa is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550. This means either Banion or Honwa has the Tela G5 and the other has a camera costing $550.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
 - The camera made by Banion costs $25 more than the DM-5000. This means the DM-5000 must cost less than the camera made by Banion.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 - The FC-520 costs $50 more than the model made by Cober. This sets a relationship between the price of the FC-520 and the camera made by Cober.
 
 Step 4: Deduce from Clues
 - Since the camera made by Banion costs $25 more than the DM-5000, and one of Banion or Honwa costs $550, the DM-5000 cannot be $550 (as it would make Banion's camera $575, which doesn't fit with the Tela G5 or $550 condition). Therefore, the DM-5000 must be priced lower than $550, but since $550 is the lowest price, this is not possible. Thus, the DM-5000 cannot be the lowest price, and Banion cannot be the one with the $550 camera. Therefore, Honwa must have the $550 camera.
 
 Step 5: Assign Prices
 - Since Honwa has the $550 camera and Banion's camera costs $25 more than the DM-5000, the DM-5000 must be priced at $575 (making Banion's camera $600).
 
 Step 6: Assign Remaining Prices
 - Since the FC-520 costs $50 more than Cober's camera, and the only prices left are $625 and $575, Cober's camera must be $575 and the FC-520 must be $625.
 
 Step 7: Assign Remaining Cameras and Companies
 - Since Banion's camera is $600 and not the DM-5000 or FC-520, it must be the Tela G5. The only remaining camera for Dayero is the G-290.
 
 Final Answer:
 $550 | Honwa | G-290
 $575 | Cober | DM-5000
 $600 | Banion | Tela G5
 $625 | Dayero | FC-520","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that one of the cameras made by Banion or Honwa is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550.
- Since we don't know which one costs $550 yet, we'll keep this information in mind for further analysis.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that the camera made by Banion costs $25 more than the DM-5000.
- This implies that the DM-5000 must be priced at one of the available prices minus $25. Since the prices are $550, $575, $600, $625, the only prices that work for DM-5000 after subtracting $25 are $525, $550, $575, $600. Since $525 is not an option, DM-5000 must be either $550, $575, or $600.

**Step 3: Combine Clue 1 and Clue 2**
- If Banion's camera costs $25 more than the DM-5000 and could be either $575, $600, or $625, and one of Banion or Honwa's cameras costs $550, it cannot be Banion's camera that costs $550.
- Therefore, Honwa's camera costs $550.

**Step 4: Further deduction from Clue 2**
- Since Honwa's camera costs $550, by Clue 2, Banion's camera must be the Tela G5.
- Since Banion's camera costs $25 more than the DM-5000, and it cannot be $550, the only options left are $575, $600, $625. 

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the FC-520 costs $50 more than the model made by Cober.
- Since we know the prices are $550, $575, $600, $625, Cober's camera must be priced at $500, $525, $550, or $575 to allow for a $50 increase. Since $500 and $525 are not options, Cober's camera must be either $550 or $575.

**Step 6: Finalize the prices**
- Since Honwa's camera costs $550 and it cannot be Cober's camera, Cober's camera must cost $575.
- Therefore, FC-520 costs $625 ($575 + $50).
- Since Banion's camera is the Tela G5 and costs $25 more than the DM-5000, and cannot be $550 or $575, it must be $600.
- Therefore, DM-5000 costs $575.

**Step 7: Assign remaining camera and company**
- The only remaining camera is G-290 and the only remaining company is Dayero.
- Since all other prices and matches are made, Dayero's G-290 must cost $550.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 4, we know that Lirios makes the Lectra 6.
 2. From Clue 1, the camera made by Lirios costs $25 more than the model made by Torvia.
 3. From Clue 3, either Torvia or Nectron makes the Tela G5, and one of them costs $550.
 4. From Clue 5, the Tela G5 costs $25 more than the Zenix 2C.
 
 Let's start by assigning prices:
 - If Torvia's camera costs $550, then Lirios's camera (Lectra 6) costs $575 (from Clue 1).
 - From Clue 5, if Tela G5 costs $25 more than Zenix 2C, and since we know the prices are $550, $575, $600, $625, we can deduce:
  - If Zenix 2C costs $550, Tela G5 would cost $575.
  - If Zenix 2C costs $575, Tela G5 would cost $600.
  - If Zenix 2C costs $600, Tela G5 would cost $625.
 
 Since Torvia's model costs $550 (from Clue 3), and Tela G5 or Zenix 2C must be one of these models, we can deduce:
 - Torvia's model cannot be Zenix 2C because Zenix 2C costs more than $550 (from Clue 2).
 - Therefore, Torvia's model must be Tela G5, and it costs $550.
 - Zenix 2C then costs $600 (since Tela G5 costs $25 more than Zenix 2C and Tela G5 is $550).
 
 Now, we know:
 - Torvia makes Tela G5, costing $550.
 - Lirios makes Lectra 6, costing $575.
 - Zenix 2C costs $600, but we don't know the company yet.
 
 From Clue 3, since Torvia makes Tela G5 and costs $550, Nectron must make Zenix 2C, costing $600.
 
 The remaining camera, DM-5000, costing $625, must be made by Dayero, as it's the only company and price left.
 
 Final Answer:
 $550 | Torvia | Tela G5
 $575 | Lirios | Lectra 6
 $600 | Nectron | Zenix 2C
 $625 | Dayero | DM-5000","Step-by-step solution:

1. **Clue 4**: The camera made by Lirios is the Lectra 6.
   - Lirios -> Lectra 6

2. **Clue 3**: Of the camera made by Torvia and the model made by Nectron, one is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550.
   - Since one of these cameras costs $550 and the other is Tela G5, we need to determine which is which. We will resolve this as we gather more information.

3. **Clue 5**: The Tela G5 costs 25 dollars more than the Zenix 2C.
   - This sets a relative price difference between Tela G5 and Zenix 2C.

4. **Clue 1**: The camera made by Lirios costs 25 dollars more than the model made by Torvia.
   - Since Lirios -> Lectra 6, and it costs $25 more than Torvia's model, we need to find the price of Torvia's model to determine the price of Lectra 6.

5. **Clue 2**: The Zenix 2C costs more than the model made by Torvia.
   - This indicates that Zenix 2C is priced higher than Torvia's camera.

6. **Using Clues 3 and 5**: If Tela G5 costs $25 more than Zenix 2C and Zenix 2C costs more than Torvia's model, we can start assigning possible prices:
   - If Torvia's model is the one costing $550 (from Clue 3), then Zenix 2C cannot be the lowest price since it costs more than Torvia's model. Therefore, Zenix 2C must be at least $575.
   - Since Tela G5 costs $25 more than Zenix 2C, if Zenix 2C is $575, Tela G5 would be $600.

7. **Assigning prices**:
   - Torvia's model costs $550.
   - Zenix 2C costs $575.
   - Tela G5 costs $600.
   - Lectra 6 (Lirios) costs $625 (since it's $25 more than Torvia's model).

8. **Remaining assignments**:
   - The only remaining camera is DM-5000 and the only remaining company is Dayero.
   - Dayero -> DM-5000

 4. From Clue 2, Chester's canine is either the one that won in 2006 or the beagle. Since the beagle won in 2006, Chester's dog must be the beagle.
 
 5. From Clue 4, of the dog that won in 2009 and the dog that won in 2006, one is the pekingese and the other is Fernando's. Since the pekingese won in 2008 (from Clue 5 and Clue 3), Fernando's dog must have won in 2009.
 
 6. The remaining breed for 2007 is the maltese, and the remaining owner is Barbara.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 2006 | Chester | beagle
 2007 | Barbara | maltese
 2008 | Elsie | pekingese
 2009 | Fernando | great dane","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- Elsie's canine won in 2008.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 5
- The beagle won 2 years before the pekingese.
- Since the beagle won 2 years before the pekingese, if the beagle won in 2006, the pekingese won in 2008. But from Clue 3, Elsie's dog won in 2008, so the beagle cannot have won in 2006. Therefore, the beagle won in 2007 and the pekingese in 2009.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The canine that won in 2006, the beagle, and the maltese are all different dogs.
- Since the beagle won in 2007 and the pekingese in 2009, the dog that won in 2006 is neither the beagle nor the pekingese. It must be the maltese.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- Of the canine that won in 2009 and the dog that won in 2006, one is the pekingese and the other is Fernando's.
- Since the pekingese won in 2009, Fernando's dog must be the one that won in 2006, which is the maltese.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 2
- Chester's canine is either the canine that won in 2006 or the beagle.
- Since Fernando's dog won in 2006 and it is the maltese, Chester's dog must be the beagle, which won in 2007.

Step 6: Assign Remaining Owner and Breed
- Owners left: Barbara
- Breeds left: great dane
- Since Elsie's dog (2008) is not yet assigned a breed and the only breed left for 2008 is the great dane, Elsie's dog is the great dane.

342.json,"The International Bigfoot Sighting Registry (IBSR) has recorded a number of unusual witnesses accounts this year from different parts of Caribou County. Using only the clues below, match the months to the options from witnesses and locations. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

months : March, April, May, June.
witnesses : Francis, Hannah, Jenny, Wanda.
locations : Bald Hill Run, Juniper Springs, Laurel Grove, Seryl Forest.

Clues:
1. Of the sighting at Laurel Grove and Francis's account, one happened in March and the other happened in May.
2. Hannah's event took place 2 months after the account at Seryl Forest.
3. The March account and the sighting at Laurel Grove were different events.
4. The account at Juniper Springs was either the April sighting or Hannah's sighting.
5. The sighting at Seryl Forest was either Wanda's event or the June event.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
March | correct option from witnesses | correct option from locations
April | correct option from witnesses | correct option from locations
May | correct option from witnesses | correct option from locations
June | correct option from witnesses | correct option from locations
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, the March account and the sighting at Laurel Grove are different events. This means that if one is in March, the other is not.
 
 2. From Clue 1, either Francis's account or the sighting at Laurel Grove happened in March, and the other in May. Since from Clue 3, March and Laurel Grove are different events, Laurel Grove must be in May, and Francis's account must be in March.
 
 3. From Clue 5, the sighting at Seryl Forest was either Wanda's event or the June event. Since we know Francis's account is in March, Wanda's event must be in June at Seryl Forest.
 
 4. From Clue 2, Hannah's event took place 2 months after the account at Seryl Forest. Since Seryl Forest is in June, Hannah's event must be in August, but since we only have months up to June, we need to adjust. Since Seryl Forest is in June, and Hannah's event is 2 months after, this means Seryl Forest must be in April, and Hannah's event is in June. However, we already established Wanda's event in June at Seryl Forest. This means Seryl Forest must be in April, and Hannah's event is in June at another location.
 
 5. From Clue 4, the account at Juniper Springs was either the April sighting or Hannah's sighting. Since Seryl Forest is in April, Juniper Springs must be Hannah's sighting in June.
 
 6. The only remaining month for Jenny is May, and the only remaining location for May (Laurel Grove already assigned) is Bald Hill Run.
 
 Final Answer:
 March | Francis | Juniper Springs
 April | Wanda | Seryl Forest
 May | Jenny | Laurel Grove
 June | Hannah | Bald Hill Run","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
- The March account and the sighting at Laurel Grove were different events.
This means that the sighting at Laurel Grove did not occur in March.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- Of the sighting at Laurel Grove and Francis's account, one happened in March and the other happened in May.
Since Laurel Grove did not occur in March (from Step 1), Laurel Grove must have occurred in May and Francis's account must have occurred in March.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 5
- The sighting at Seryl Forest was either Wanda's event or the June event.
This clue suggests two possibilities: Seryl Forest in June or Wanda's event at Seryl Forest.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- Hannah's event took place 2 months after the account at Seryl Forest.
If Seryl Forest was in June (from Step 3), Hannah's event would be in August, which is not a valid month. Therefore, Seryl Forest must have occurred in April, and Hannah's event must have occurred in June.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 4
- The account at Juniper Springs was either the April sighting or Hannah's sighting.
Since Hannah's event is in June (from Step 4), Juniper Springs must be Hannah's sighting in June.

Step 6: Deduce Remaining Information
- From the above steps, we know:
  - March: Francis's account
  - April: Seryl Forest sighting
  - May: Laurel Grove sighting
  - June: Hannah's sighting at Juniper Springs
- Wanda's event must be the remaining month and location. Since Seryl Forest in April and Juniper Springs in June are taken, and Laurel Grove in May is taken, Wanda's event must be in March at Bald Hill Run.
- Jenny's event is the only one left, which must be in May at Laurel Grove.

Final Answer:
March | Francis | Bald Hill Run
April | Wanda | Seryl Forest
May | Jenny | Laurel Grove
June | Hannah | Juniper Springs

12:07am | correct option from names | correct option from families
12:10am | correct option from names | correct option from families
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 Peggy was born 6 minutes before the Underwoods' baby. This means Peggy must have been born at 12:01am, and the Underwoods' baby at 12:07am.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
 The four babies were Maxine, the child born at 12:10am, the Blanchards' baby, and the baby born at 12:07am. Since the Underwoods' baby was born at 12:07am, the Blanchards' baby must be either Maxine or the child born at 12:10am.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
 Of the Ortegas' child and the baby born at 12:10am, one was Luis and the other was Susan. Since the baby born at 12:10am is either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby, it cannot be Susan or Luis. Therefore, the Ortegas' child must be either Susan or Luis, and the baby born at 12:10am must be Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
 The Ortegas' baby was either Susan or the child born at 12:04am. Since the Ortegas' baby is either Susan or Luis, and the baby born at 12:10am is not Susan or Luis, the Ortegas' baby must be Susan, and she must be born at 12:04am.
 
 Step 5: Deduce Remaining Information
 - Peggy was born at 12:01am, and the Underwoods' baby was born at 12:07am.
 - Susan is the Ortegas' baby and was born at 12:04am.
 - The baby born at 12:10am must be Maxine, and since the Blanchards' baby is either Maxine or the baby born at 12:10am, Maxine is the Blanchards' baby.
 - The only remaining name and family for the baby born at 12:07am are Luis and Underwood.
 
 Final Answer:
 12:01am | Peggy | Vaughan
 12:04am | Susan | Ortega
 12:07am | Luis | Underwood
 12:10am | Maxine | Blanchard","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Peggy was born 6 minutes before the Underwoods' baby.
  - This means Peggy must have been born at 12:01am, and the Underwoods' baby at 12:07am.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- The four babies were Maxine, the child born at 12:10am, the Blanchards' baby, and the baby born at 12:07am.
  - Since the Underwoods' baby was born at 12:07am, this baby cannot be Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
  - Therefore, the baby born at 12:10am must be either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the Ortegas' child and the baby born at 12:10am, one was Luis and the other was Susan.
  - Since the baby born at 12:10am is either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby, it cannot be Luis or Susan.
  - Therefore, the Ortegas' baby must be either Luis or Susan and not born at 12:10am.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- The Ortegas' baby was either Susan or the child born at 12:04am.
  - From Step 3, the Ortegas' baby is either Luis or Susan.
  - If the Ortegas' baby is Susan, then she must be born at 12:04am.
  - If the Ortegas' baby is Luis, then Susan must be born at 12:10am, but this contradicts Clue 4 where the baby born at 12:10am is either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
  - Therefore, Susan is the Ortegas' baby born at 12:04am.

**Step 5: Deduce Remaining Information**
- Peggy was born at 12:01am, Susan at 12:04am, and the Underwoods' baby at 12:07am.
- The baby born at 12:10am must be Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
- Since the Underwoods' baby is at 12:07am, the Blanchards' baby must be Maxine born at 12:10am.
- The remaining baby, Luis, must be born at 12:07am.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
- 12:01am | Peggy | Vaughan (remaining family)

Using only the clues below, match the years to the options from islands and cultures. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

years : 1754, 1761, 1768, 1775.
islands : Fushil, Nuhirk, Verinya, Zafet.
cultures : Enakai, Manika'i, Kukani, Wainani.

Clues:
1. Zafet was either the island on which the Kukani people lived or the island on which the Manika'i people lived.
2. Of the island on which the Kukani people lived and the island on which the Wainani people lived, one was discovered in 1761 and the other was Nuhirk.
3. Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk.
4. The island on which the Enakai people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1754 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1761 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1768 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1775 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk. This means if we place Nuhirk in 1775, Verinya would be in 1768. If Nuhirk is in 1768, Verinya would be in 1761, and so on. We need to keep this in mind as we proceed.
 
 2. From Clue 5, Fushil was either discovered in 1768 or 1754. We'll consider both possibilities as we continue.
 
 3. From Clue 2, one of the islands where Kukani or Wainani lived was discovered in 1761, and the other was Nuhirk. This means Nuhirk cannot be in 1761 because it would contradict the clue. If Nuhirk is in 1775, then the island discovered in 1761 must be where either Kukani or Wainani lived.
 
 4. From Clue 1, Zafet was either where Kukani or Manika'i lived. Since we know from Clue 2 that either Kukani or Wainani was discovered in 1761, and Zafet is not mentioned in Clue 2, Zafet cannot be the island discovered in 1761.
 
 5. From Clue 4, the island where Enakai lived was discovered after the island where Manika'i lived. This means Manika'i's island must be one of the earlier ones.
 
 6. Let's place Nuhirk in 1775 (as it fits with Verinya being discovered 7 years earlier, which would be 1768). This means Verinya cannot be where Kukani or Wainani lived (since one of them is in 1761). Therefore, Verinya must be where Enakai lived, and Fushil must be in 1754.
 
 7. Since Verinya (1768) is where Enakai lived, and it must be after Manika'i's island, Manika'i cannot be in 1775. If we place Manika'i in 1761, then Zafet must be the island discovered in 1761 (since Zafet is either Kukani or Manika'i, and Kukani or Wainani is in 1761).
 
 8. This leaves Kukani in 1761 on Zafet, and Wainani must be on Nuhirk in 1775.
 
 Final Answer:
 1754 | Fushil | (not yet determined)
 1761 | Zafet | Kukani
 1768 | Verinya | Enakai
 1775 | Nuhirk | Wainani
 
 We still need to determine the culture for Fushil in 1754. Since all other cultures are assigned, Fushil must be where the remaining culture, Manika'i, lived.
 
 Final Answer:
 1754 | Fushil | Manika'i
 1761 | Zafet | Kukani
 1768 | Verinya | Enakai
 1775 | Nuhirk | Wainani","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 5**
Fushil was either discovered in 1768 or 1754. This means Fushil cannot be associated with 1761 or 1775.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk. This means if we assign a year to Verinya, Nuhirk must be exactly 7 years later. The possible pairs are (1754, 1761) and (1768, 1775).

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
Of the island on which the Kukani people lived and the island on which the Wainani people lived, one was discovered in 1761 and the other was Nuhirk. Since Nuhirk can only be 1761 or 1775 (from Step 2), and one of these or 1761 must be where Kukani or Wainani lived, we can deduce that if Nuhirk is 1775, then the island discovered in 1761 must be associated with either Kukani or Wainani.

**Step 4: Combine Clues 2 and 3**
If Verinya was discovered in 1768, then Nuhirk was discovered in 1775. This fits with Clue 2, where one of the islands (Nuhirk or the one discovered in 1761) must be associated with Kukani or Wainani. Thus, Verinya is 1768 and Nuhirk is 1775.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 1**
Zafet was either the island on which the Kukani people lived or the island on which the Manika'i people lived. Since we know from Clue 2 that Kukani or Wainani must be associated with 1761 or Nuhirk (1775), and Zafet is neither of these years, Zafet must be associated with Manika'i.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Years**
From Step 1, Fushil was either 1768 or 1754. Since Verinya is 1768, Fushil must be 1754. The remaining year, 1761, must then be associated with the remaining island, which is not yet used, and from Clue 2, it must be associated with either Kukani or Wainani.

**Step 7: Finalize Assignments**
- Fushil (1754) cannot be Kukani or Wainani (from Clue 2), so it must be Enakai.
- Verinya (1768) cannot be Kukani or Wainani (from Clue 2), so it must be Manika'i.
- Nuhirk (1775) must be Wainani (since Kukani is left for 1761).
- Zafet (1761) must be Kukani (from Clue 1).

Final Answer:
1754 | Fushil | Enakai
1761 | Zafet | Kukani

Clues:
1. Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez and the game released in May are all different apps.
2. Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic.
3. Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
March | correct option from games | correct option from developers
April | correct option from games | correct option from developers
May | correct option from games | correct option from developers
June | correct option from games | correct option from developers
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, we know that Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez, and the game released in May are all different apps. This means that Vitalinks is not released by BeGamez and not released in May.
 
 2. From Clue 2, Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic. This means Wizard World cannot be released in March, and Apptastic's game cannot be released in June.
 
 3. From Clue 3, Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka. This means Angry Ants cannot be released in June, and Peter Parka cannot be released in March.
 
 4. From Clue 4, of Peter Parka and the application released in May, one was made by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo. This means that either Peter Parka or the May release is by Apptastic, and the other is by Gadingo.
 
 Let's start placing the games:
 - Since Wizard World is released 1 month after Apptastic's game, and Apptastic's game cannot be in June, Apptastic's game must be in either March, April, or May. Wizard World then must be in either April, May, or June.
 - Since Angry Ants is 1 month before Peter Parka, and Peter Parka cannot be in March, Angry Ants cannot be in June. If Angry Ants is in March, Peter Parka must be in April.
 
 Let's assign:
 - Angry Ants in March, Peter Parka in April.
 
 Now, since Peter Parka is in April and one of Peter Parka or May's game is by Apptastic, Apptastic cannot be in May. If Apptastic is in March, Wizard World would be in April, but Peter Parka is already there. So, Apptastic must be in April (Peter Parka), and Wizard World in May. This leaves Gadingo for May.
 
 Now, since BeGamez cannot be in May and Vitalinks is not by BeGamez or in May, BeGamez must be in June. This leaves Vortia for March.
 
 Final Answer:
 March | Angry Ants | Vortia
 April | Peter Parka | Apptastic
 May | Wizard World | Gadingo
 June | Vitalinks | BeGamez","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze the clues
- Clue 3 states that Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka. This means they cannot be in March and June respectively, as there is no month before March and no month after June.

Step 2: Apply Clue 4
- Clue 4 states that of Peter Parka and the application released in May, one was made by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo. Since we don't know which is which yet, we keep this in mind for cross-referencing with other clues.

Step 3: Apply Clue 2
- Clue 2 states that Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic. This means Apptastic's app cannot be in June, as there is no month after June.

Step 4: Apply Clue 1
- Clue 1 states that Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez, and the game released in May are all different apps. This means Vitalinks cannot be the game released in May and cannot be developed by BeGamez in May.

Step 5: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 2
- Since Angry Ants is released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka, and Wizard World is released 1 month after Apptastic's app, we can start placing them:
  - If Angry Ants is in March, Peter Parka must be in April.
  - If Apptastic's app is in April (Peter Parka or another), Wizard World must be in May.

Step 6: Apply Clue 4 with the above deductions
- Since Peter Parka is in April and Wizard World is in May, and one of them is developed by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo, and knowing from Clue 2 that Wizard World comes after Apptastic's app, it follows:
  - Apptastic developed the app in April (Peter Parka), and Gadingo developed Wizard World in May.

Step 7: Place remaining game and developer
- With Angry Ants in March, Peter Parka (Apptastic) in April, Wizard World (Gadingo) in May, the remaining month is June, and the remaining game and developer are Vitalinks and BeGamez.

Step 8: Determine the developer for March
- The remaining developer for Angry Ants in March is Vortia, as all other developers are accounted for in other months.

2. Of the squad that dropped at Anthon Ridge and the team that jumped at 10:00am, one is Foxtrot Group and the other is India Group.
3. Of the team that jumped at 9:00am and the squad that jumped at 10:00am, one is India Group and the other was dropped at Crestline X.
4. Charlie Group deployed 1 hour before India Group.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
8:00am | correct option from teams | correct option from locations
9:00am | correct option from teams | correct option from locations
10:00am | correct option from teams | correct option from locations
11:00am | correct option from teams | correct option from locations
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 4 first, which states that Charlie Group deployed 1 hour before India Group. This means Charlie Group could be at either 8:00am or 9:00am, and India Group would then be at either 9:00am or 10:00am respectively.
 
 Step 2: Clue 3 states that of the team that jumped at 9:00am and the squad that jumped at 10:00am, one is India Group and the other was dropped at Crestline X. Since we know from Step 1 that India Group could be at 9:00am or 10:00am, we can deduce that if India is at 9:00am, then Crestline X is at 10:00am, and vice versa.
 
 Step 3: Clue 2 states that of the squad that dropped at Anthon Ridge and the team that jumped at 10:00am, one is Foxtrot Group and the other is India Group. Since we know from Step 2 that India Group could be at 10:00am, it means Foxtrot Group must be at Anthon Ridge, and thus India Group is at 10:00am.
 
 Step 4: From Step 3, since India Group is at 10:00am, from Clue 3, Crestline X must be at 9:00am. Therefore, the team at 9:00am is not India but the other option, which must be Whiskey Group (since Foxtrot is at Anthon Ridge and Charlie is 1 hour before India).
 
 Step 5: From Step 1 and Step 4, since Charlie Group is 1 hour before India Group and India Group is at 10:00am, Charlie Group must be at 9:00am. But from Step 4, Whiskey is at 9:00am, so Charlie must be at 8:00am.
 
 Step 6: The remaining team for 11:00am must be Foxtrot Group, and the remaining location for 8:00am must be Ezra Forest (from Clue 1, since Charlie is at 8:00am and one option for Charlie was Ezra Forest).
 
 Step 7: The remaining location for 11:00am must be Frazier Park.
 
 Final Answer:
 8:00am | Charlie | Ezra Forest
 9:00am | Whiskey | Crestline X
 10:00am | India | Anthon Ridge
 11:00am | Foxtrot | Frazier Park","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
- Charlie Group deployed 1 hour before India Group.
This means Charlie cannot be at the latest time (11:00am) and India cannot be at the earliest time (8:00am).

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- Charlie Group is either the squad that jumped at 8:00am or the squad that dropped at Ezra Forest.
Since Charlie cannot be at 11:00am and must be 1 hour before India, Charlie can only be at 8:00am or 10:00am. But since India cannot be at 8:00am, Charlie must be at 8:00am.

Step 3: Place Charlie Group
- Charlie Group is at 8:00am.
This leaves the location for Charlie Group to be determined between Ezra Forest and others.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 3
- Of the squad that dropped at Anthon Ridge and the team that jumped at 10:00am, one is Foxtrot Group and the other is India Group.
- Of the team that jumped at 9:00am and the squad that jumped at 10:00am, one is India Group and the other was dropped at Crestline X.
Since Charlie is at 8:00am, India must be at 10:00am (from Clue 4). This means Foxtrot cannot be at 10:00am and must be at Anthon Ridge.

Step 5: Place India Group
- India Group is at 10:00am.
This means the location at 10:00am cannot be Anthon Ridge (Foxtrot is there) and must be Crestline X (from Clue 3).

Step 6: Place Foxtrot Group
- Foxtrot Group is at Anthon Ridge.
This leaves the time for Foxtrot to be determined.

Step 7: Deduce Remaining Slots
- Since India is at 10:00am and Charlie is at 8:00am, Foxtrot must be at 9:00am.
- Whiskey Group is the only team left, so they must be at 11:00am.

Step 8: Deduce Remaining Locations
- Locations left are Ezra Forest and Frazier Park.
- Since Charlie is either at 8:00am or Ezra Forest (from Clue 1) and Charlie is at 8:00am, Charlie must be at Ezra Forest.
- This leaves Frazier Park for Whiskey Group at 11:00am.

Final Answer:
8:00am | Charlie | Ezra Forest
9:00am | Foxtrot | Anthon Ridge
10:00am | India | Crestline X

343.json,"The Norfolk Times recently sponsored a ""Sail Around the World"" race that pitted dozens of sailors against each other to see who could circumnavigate the globe, solo, in the fewest number of days. Using only the clues below, match the days to the options from sailors and boat types. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

days : 270, 274, 278, 282.
sailors : Ed Alexander, Tara Carroll, Vicky Estes, Wendell Orr.
boat types : gaff cutter, pilot cutter, schooner, sloop.

Clues:
1. Wendell Orr was either the sailor who finished in 270 days or the person in the gaff cutter.
2. Of Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop, one finished in 270 days and the other finished in 278 days.
3. Tara Carroll took 4 more days to finish than Ed Alexander.
4. The sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days to finish than Ed Alexander.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
270 | correct option from sailors | correct option from boat types
274 | correct option from sailors | correct option from boat types
278 | correct option from sailors | correct option from boat types
282 | correct option from sailors | correct option from boat types
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 Wendell Orr either finished in 270 days or was in the gaff cutter.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop finished either in 270 days or 278 days.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 Tara Carroll took 4 more days to finish than Ed Alexander.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 The sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days to finish than Ed Alexander.
 
 Step 5: Deduce from Clue 4 and Clue 3
 If the pilot cutter sailor took 4 fewer days than Ed Alexander, and Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed Alexander, then Ed Alexander cannot be the pilot cutter sailor. This means Tara Carroll cannot be the pilot cutter sailor either, as the difference in their days is exactly 8 days.
 
 Step 6: Assign days based on Clue 4
 If Ed Alexander is not in the pilot cutter, and the pilot cutter sailor took 4 fewer days than Ed Alexander, we need to find a pair of days that are 4 days apart. The possible pairs are (270, 274), (274, 278), and (278, 282). Since Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed Alexander, and their difference is 8 days, Ed Alexander must be in one of the middle days (274 or 278).
 
 Step 7: Assign days to Tara Carroll
 If Ed Alexander took 274 days, Tara Carroll took 282 days. If Ed Alexander took 278 days, Tara Carroll took 286 days (which is not an option). Therefore, Ed Alexander took 274 days, and Tara Carroll took 282 days.
 
 Step 8: Assign boat types
 Since Ed Alexander took 274 days and the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days, the pilot cutter finished in 270 days. Wendell Orr was either 270 days or in the gaff cutter. Since 270 days is taken by the pilot cutter, Wendell Orr must be in the gaff cutter.
 
 Step 9: Assign remaining sailor to 270 days
 Since the pilot cutter finished in 270 days and it's not Wendell Orr, it must be Vicky Estes or the competitor in the sloop. From Clue 2, Vicky Estes and the sloop finished either in 270 or 278 days. Since the pilot cutter is not a sloop, Vicky Estes must be in the pilot cutter.
 
 Step 10: Assign remaining days and boat types
 Wendell Orr is in the gaff cutter, and the only remaining day is 278. The sloop then must be the remaining boat type for 278 days, which means the competitor in the sloop is Ed Alexander. The only remaining sailor for 278 days is Tara Carroll, but she is already assigned 282 days. Thus, Wendell Orr must be 278 days, and the remaining sailor, Tara Carroll, must be in the schooner at 282 days.
 
 Final Answer:
 270 | Vicky Estes | pilot cutter
 274 | Ed Alexander | sloop
 278 | Wendell Orr | gaff cutter
 282 | Tara Carroll | schooner","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
Wendell Orr was either the sailor who finished in 270 days or the person in the gaff cutter.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
Of Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop, one finished in 270 days and the other finished in 278 days.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
Tara Carroll took 4 more days to finish than Ed Alexander.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
The sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days to finish than Ed Alexander.

**Step 5: Deductions from Clues 3 and 4**
If the sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days than Ed Alexander, and Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed Alexander, then:
- If Ed Alexander took x days, Tara Carroll took x + 4 days, and the sailor in the pilot cutter took x - 4 days.

**Step 6: Possible Days Assignment**
From the days given (270, 274, 278, 282), and using the deductions:
- If Ed Alexander took 278 days (middle value to allow +4 and -4 days), then Tara Carroll took 282 days, and the sailor in the pilot cutter took 274 days.

**Step 7: Assigning Days Based on Clue 2**
Since Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop had to finish in either 270 or 278 days:
- If Ed Alexander is not in the sloop (as he took 278 days), then Vicky Estes cannot be in 278 days. Thus, Vicky Estes must be the one who finished in 270 days, and the sloop competitor finished in 278 days.

**Step 8: Assigning Boat Types**
- Since the pilot cutter finished in 274 days, and Ed Alexander took 278 days, Ed Alexander cannot be in the pilot cutter.
- Wendell Orr must be in the gaff cutter (from Clue 1), and since he is not the one who finished in 270 days (Vicky Estes did), he must be the one who finished in 282 days.

**Step 9: Remaining Assignments**
- Tara Carroll, who took 282 days, cannot be Wendell Orr or Vicky Estes, and she is not Ed Alexander. Thus, she must be in the remaining boat type, which is the schooner.
- The remaining sailor for 278 days and the sloop is Ed Alexander.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
first | correct option from teams | correct option from colors
second | correct option from teams | correct option from colors
third | correct option from teams | correct option from colors
fourth | correct option from teams | correct option from colors
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 - The ""Night Ninjas"" was ranked 1 place ahead of the ""Oil Crew"". This means if Night Ninjas are in position n, then Oil Crew is in position n+1.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
 - The ""Target Bombs"" was ranked 1 place behind the orange team. This means if the orange team is in position m, then Target Bombs are in position m+1.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 - Of the ""Oil Crew"" and the group that finished third, one uses orange paintballs and the other uses red paintballs. Since we know from Clue 1 that Oil Crew is directly after Night Ninjas, and from Clue 4 that Target Bombs is directly after the orange team, we can deduce that Oil Crew and the third place team must be either orange or red.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
 - The ""Splat Squad"", the purple team, and the team that finished third are all different teams. This means Splat Squad cannot be third or purple.
 
 Step 5: Deduction from Clues 1, 3, and 4
 - If Oil Crew is orange, then they cannot be third (as per Clue 3). Therefore, the third team must be red. This means Oil Crew is orange and not third. Since Night Ninjas are ahead of Oil Crew, Night Ninjas cannot be first. Therefore, Night Ninjas are second, Oil Crew is third (orange), and the first team must be the one ahead of Night Ninjas.
 
 Step 6: Deduction from Clue 2 and previous steps
 - Since Splat Squad is neither third nor purple, and since Oil Crew is orange and third, Splat Squad must be first or fourth. Since Night Ninjas are second and not purple, and Oil Crew is orange, Splat Squad must be purple and cannot be third, so they are fourth.
 
 Step 7: Final placements
 - Since Splat Squad is purple and fourth, and Oil Crew is orange and third, the first team must be the one that is not Night Ninjas, Oil Crew, or Splat Squad, which is Target Bombs. Since Target Bombs is behind the orange team, the only color left for Target Bombs is yellow. Night Ninjas must then be red.
 
 Final Answer:
 first | Target Bombs | yellow
 second | Night Ninjas | red
 third | Oil Crew | orange
 fourth | Splat Squad | purple","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- ""Night Ninjas"" was ranked 1 place ahead of the ""Oil Crew"".
- This means if Night Ninjas are in position n, Oil Crew must be in position n+1.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- ""Target Bombs"" was ranked 1 place behind the orange team.
- If the orange team is in position m, Target Bombs must be in position m+1.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Of the ""Oil Crew"" and the group that finished third, one uses orange paintballs and the other uses red paintballs.
- Since Oil Crew is either directly before or after the orange team (from Clue 4), Oil Crew must be either orange or red.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- ""Splat Squad"", the purple team, and the team that finished third are all different teams.
- This means Splat Squad cannot be third or purple.

Step 5: Deduce from Clues 1, 2, 3, and 4
- If Night Ninjas are first, Oil Crew must be second (from Clue 1).
- If Oil Crew is second and uses either orange or red (from Clue 3), and since the orange team is directly followed by Target Bombs (from Clue 4), Oil Crew cannot be orange (as Target Bombs would then be third, conflicting with Clue 2 where the third team is not Splat Squad or purple).
- Therefore, Oil Crew must be red and second. The orange team must be third, and Target Bombs fourth.

Step 6: Assign remaining colors and positions
- Since Splat Squad cannot be third or purple (from Clue 2), and third is orange, Splat Squad must be first or fourth. Since purple is not third and Splat Squad is not purple, purple must be fourth.
- Therefore, Splat Squad is first and yellow (as all other colors are assigned).

Step 7: Assign remaining team
- Night Ninjas must be purple and third (as all other positions and colors are assigned).

$3.60 | correct option from customers | correct option from orders
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, we know that either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink and one of them ordered the iced americano. 
 
 2. From Clue 1, Darrell's drink cost 20 cents less than Charlie's. Since Charlie's drink could be either $3.60 or the one costing 20 cents less than $3.60, we can calculate the possible prices for Darrell's drink. If Charlie's drink is $3.60, Darrell's drink would be $3.40.
 
 3. From Clue 3, Jacob's drink cost 20 cents less than the espresso. This means the espresso must be more expensive than Jacob's drink by 20 cents.
 
 4. From Clue 4, the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink. Since Darrell's drink is $3.40, the vanilla latte must be more than $3.40.
 
 5. Since the vanilla latte costs more than $3.40 and must be more than Darrell's drink, it can only be $3.50 or $3.60. But since either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink, and it's either the iced americano or another drink, the vanilla latte must be $3.50.
 
 6. Since the vanilla latte is $3.50, and it's not ordered by Darrell, Charlie, or Henry (as per Clue 2 and the price), it must be ordered by Jacob.
 
 7. Since Jacob ordered the vanilla latte at $3.50, and Jacob's drink is 20 cents less than the espresso (Clue 3), the espresso must be $3.70, but since $3.70 is not an option, we need to adjust. Since Jacob's drink is $3.50, the espresso must be $3.60.
 
 8. Since the espresso is $3.60, and it's not ordered by Jacob, it must be ordered by either Henry or Charlie. Since Charlie's drink costs more than Darrell's and Darrell's is $3.40, Charlie's drink must be $3.60. Therefore, Charlie ordered the espresso.
 
 9. Since Charlie ordered the espresso at $3.60, and Henry or Charlie ordered the iced americano, Henry must have ordered the iced americano. The only price left for the iced americano is $3.40.
 
 10. The only remaining customer and drink combination is Darrell with the macchiato at $3.30.
 
 Final Answer:
 $3.30 | Darrell | macchiato
 $3.40 | Henry | iced americano
 $3.50 | Jacob | vanilla latte
 $3.60 | Charlie | espresso","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
- The beverage that cost $3.60 and the iced americano are ordered by Henry and Charlie. This means one of these two customers ordered the $3.60 drink and the other ordered the iced americano.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
- Darrell's coffee cost 20 cents less than Charlie's. Since we know from Step 1 that Charlie either ordered the $3.60 drink or the iced americano, we can start to consider the prices around these options.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- Jacob's drink cost 20 cents less than the espresso. This clue will help us once we identify the price of the espresso.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The vanilla latte cost more than Darrell's beverage. This helps us place the vanilla latte in a higher price bracket relative to Darrell's order.

Step 5: Deductions from Clues 1 and 2
- If Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink, Darrell's drink would be $3.40 (20 cents less). If Charlie ordered the iced americano, we need to find the price of the iced americano to determine Darrell's drink price.

Step 6: Further Deductions
- Since the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink and Darrell's drink could be $3.40 or less, the vanilla latte cannot be the lowest price. It must be higher than $3.40.

Step 7: Assigning Prices
- If we assign the $3.60 price to Charlie and he didn't order the iced americano, then he must have ordered something else, possibly the espresso or vanilla latte. Since the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink, and Darrell's drink is 20 cents less than Charlie's, Darrell cannot have the highest price. Thus, Charlie did not order the iced americano; he ordered the $3.60 drink. Henry then ordered the iced americano.

Step 8: Price of Espresso and Jacob's Order
- Since Jacob's drink is 20 cents less than the espresso, and we know the prices left are $3.30 and $3.50, the espresso must be $3.50, making Jacob's drink $3.30.

Step 9: Finalizing Orders
- Darrell's drink is 20 cents less than Charlie's. Since Charlie's drink is $3.60, Darrell's must be $3.40. The only option left for the vanilla latte, which is more than $3.40, is $3.50. Therefore, espresso is $3.50, and since Jacob's drink is 20 cents less, he must have ordered the macchiato at $3.30.

Final Answer:
$3.30 | Jacob | macchiato

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$2 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
$5 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors

$11 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, Amerigo made $6 million less than the movie directed by Hick Harmon.
 2. From Clue 2, Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo.
 3. From Clue 4, either the movie directed by Nan Norman or Easy to Love made $11 million, and the other made $2 million.
 
 Let's start by determining the earnings of Amerigo and Zephyr Breeze:
 - If Amerigo made $2 million, then Zephyr Breeze made $2 million + $6 million = $8 million.
 - If Amerigo made $5 million, then Zephyr Breeze made $5 million + $6 million = $11 million.
 - Amerigo cannot have made $8 million or $11 million because Zephyr Breeze would then exceed the maximum earnings of $11 million.
 
 Let's analyze the possibilities:
 - If Amerigo made $2 million, then Zephyr Breeze made $8 million.
 - If Amerigo made $5 million, then Zephyr Breeze made $11 million.
 
 Now, let's use Clue 1:
 - If Amerigo made $2 million, then the movie directed by Hick Harmon made $2 million + $6 million = $8 million.
 - If Amerigo made $5 million, then the movie directed by Hick Harmon made $5 million + $6 million = $11 million.
 
 Now, let's use Clue 4:
 - If Nan Norman directed a movie that made $11 million, then Easy to Love made $2 million, or vice versa.
 
 Let's consider the earnings of $11 million:
 - If Zephyr Breeze made $11 million, then Amerigo made $5 million, and Hick Harmon directed a movie that made $11 million. This fits with Amerigo making $5 million and Zephyr Breeze making $11 million.
 
 Now, let's use Clue 3:
 - Micah Moreno's movie made somewhat more than Tippecanoe. If Tippecanoe made $2 million, then Micah Moreno's movie could be the one that made $5 million.
 
 Finalizing the directors:
 - Hick Harmon directed Zephyr Breeze ($11 million).
 - Micah Moreno directed Amerigo ($5 million).
 - Nan Norman and Easy to Love are left with $2 million and $8 million. Since one of them must be $11 million or $2 million, Nan Norman directed the movie that made $2 million, and Easy to Love made $8 million.
 - Odette Olson directed Tippecanoe ($2 million).
 
 Final Answer:
 $2 million | Tippecanoe | Odette Olson
 $5 million | Amerigo | Micah Moreno
 $8 million | Easy to Love | Nan Norman
 $11 million | Zephyr Breeze | Hick Harmon","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 2**
- Clue 1 states that Amerigo made $6 million less than the movie directed by Hick Harmon.
- Clue 2 states that Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo.

From these clues, we can establish a relationship between the earnings of Amerigo, Zephyr Breeze, and the movie directed by Hick Harmon. However, we need more information to assign specific values.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that of the movie directed by Nan Norman and Easy to Love, one made $11 million and the other made $2 million.

This clue gives us specific earnings for two movies, but we don't yet know which movie corresponds to which earning.

**Step 3: Deduce from Clue 4 and Clue 1**
- If Amerigo made $2 million (the lowest possible from the given earnings), then the movie directed by Hick Harmon would have made $8 million (since Amerigo made $6 million less than Hick Harmon's movie). 
- However, if Amerigo made $5 million, then Hick Harmon's movie would have made $11 million. This fits within the available earnings and aligns with Clue 2, where Zephyr Breeze would then make $11 million ($6 million more than Amerigo's $5 million).

**Step 4: Confirming with Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the movie directed by Micah Moreno made somewhat more than Tippecanoe.
- If Amerigo made $5 million and Zephyr Breeze made $11 million, then the remaining earnings for Micah Moreno's movie and Tippecanoe are $2 million and $8 million.
- Since Micah Moreno's movie made more than Tippecanoe, Micah Moreno's movie must be the one with $8 million, and Tippecanoe made $2 million.

**Step 5: Assigning directors to movies**
- From Step 3, Hick Harmon's movie made $11 million, which must be Zephyr Breeze.
- From Step 4, Micah Moreno's movie made $8 million, which is not yet assigned, so it must be Easy to Love.
- From Clue 4, Nan Norman's movie is either $11 million or $2 million. Since $11 million is taken by Zephyr Breeze (Hick Harmon), Nan Norman directed the movie that made $2 million, which is Tippecanoe.
- Amerigo, therefore, made $5 million and was directed by the remaining director, Odette Olson.

### Final Answer:
$2 million | Tippecanoe | Nan Norman  
$5 million | Amerigo | Odette Olson  
$8 million | Easy to Love | Micah Moreno  
$11 million | Zephyr Breeze | Hick Harmon

343.json,"Box Office Weekly is putting together its latest blog entry covering this past weekend's movie premieres. Using only the clues below, match the earnings to the options from movies and directors. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

earnings : $2 million, $5 million, $8 million, $11 million.
movies : Amerigo, Easy to Love, Fast and Dead, What a World.
directors : Hick Harmon, Linda Lynch, Nan Norman, Odette Olson.

Clues:
1. Of the film that grossed $5 million and the movie that grossed $8 million, one is Fast and Dead and the other was directed by Linda Lynch.
2. Amerigo made 3 million less than Fast and Dead.
3. Amerigo is either the film that grossed $2 million or the film directed by Nan Norman.
4. Of the film directed by Hick Harmon and the film that grossed $8 million, one is Easy to Love and the other is Fast and Dead.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$2 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
$5 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
$8 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
$11 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 - The film that grossed $5 million and the film that grossed $8 million are between Fast and Dead and a film directed by Linda Lynch. 
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 - Amerigo made $3 million less than Fast and Dead.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 - Amerigo either grossed $2 million or was directed by Nan Norman.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 - Between the film directed by Hick Harmon and the film that grossed $8 million, one is Easy to Love and the other is Fast and Dead.
 
 Step 5: Deductions
 - From Clue 4 and Clue 1, if Fast and Dead is one of the films that grossed $8 million or $5 million, and it's also either Easy to Love or directed by Hick Harmon, we can deduce that Fast and Dead did not gross $8 million (as it would conflict with it being Easy to Love or directed by Hick Harmon). Therefore, Fast and Dead grossed $5 million.
 - Linda Lynch directed the film that grossed $8 million (from Clue 1), which is not Fast and Dead, so it must be another movie.
 
 Step 6: More Deductions
 - From Clue 2 and the deduction that Fast and Dead grossed $5 million, Amerigo must have grossed $2 million (as it made $3 million less than Fast and Dead).
 - From Clue 3, since Amerigo grossed $2 million, it is not directed by Nan Norman.
 
 Step 7: Assigning Directors
 - Since Amerigo is not directed by Nan Norman and it grossed $2 million, Nan Norman must have directed another film. Since Linda Lynch directed the $8 million film, and Fast and Dead is directed by Hick Harmon (from Clue 4), Nan Norman must direct What a World.
 
 Step 8: Final Earnings and Directors
 - The remaining film, Easy to Love, must be the one that grossed $11 million and is directed by Odette Olson (as all other directors and earnings are accounted for).
 
 Final Answer:
 $2 million | Amerigo | Hick Harmon
 $5 million | Fast and Dead | Linda Lynch
 $8 million | What a World | Nan Norman
 $11 million | Easy to Love | Odette Olson","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that of the film that grossed $5 million and the film that grossed $8 million, one is Fast and Dead and the other was directed by Linda Lynch. This means Fast and Dead and Linda Lynch's movie are either $5 million or $8 million.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that Amerigo made $3 million less than Fast and Dead. Since Fast and Dead is either $5 million or $8 million, Amerigo must be either $2 million or $5 million.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that Amerigo is either the film that grossed $2 million or the film directed by Nan Norman. Combining this with Step 2, Amerigo must be the $2 million movie, as it cannot be $5 million (since Fast and Dead is either $5 million or $8 million).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that of the film directed by Hick Harmon and the film that grossed $8 million, one is Easy to Love and the other is Fast and Dead. Since we know Fast and Dead is either $5 million or $8 million, and Amerigo is $2 million, Fast and Dead must be $8 million. Therefore, Easy to Love is directed by Hick Harmon.

**Step 5: Assign remaining values**
- Since Fast and Dead is $8 million, and Amerigo is $2 million, the remaining movies are What a World and Easy to Love. Since Easy to Love is directed by Hick Harmon, What a World must be directed by Linda Lynch (from Clue 1, Linda Lynch directed either the $5 million or $8 million movie).
- The remaining earnings are $5 million and $11 million. Since Fast and Dead is $8 million, and Amerigo is $2 million, What a World must be $5 million (as it's directed by Linda Lynch from Clue 1).
- The only remaining director for Fast and Dead is Nan Norman, and the only remaining movie for $11 million is Easy to Love.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

$2 million | Amerigo | Nan Norman  
$5 million | What a World | Linda Lynch

Using only the clues below, match the distances to the options from teams and devices. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

distances : 135 ft, 150 ft, 165 ft, 180 ft.
teams : Flying Eyes, Russets, Spud Chuckers, Yukon Bolds.
devices : catapult, hybrid sling, slingshot, trebuchet.

Clues:
1. The contestants that used the trebuchet was either the group that made it to 150 ft or the Flying Eyes.
2. The group that used the catapult landed 30 feet short of the team that used the slingshot.
3. The team that made it to 135 ft was either the Flying Eyes or the contestants that used the hybrid sling.
4. The Spud Chuckers landed somewhat short of the Yukon Bolds.

165 ft | correct option from teams | correct option from devices
180 ft | correct option from teams | correct option from devices
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
 - The team that made it to 135 ft was either the Flying Eyes or the contestants that used the hybrid sling.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 5
 - Of the group that used the hybrid sling and the Russets, one scored a distance of 180 ft and the other scored a distance of 135 ft.
 - From Step 1, if the hybrid sling team made 135 ft, then Russets made 180 ft, and vice versa.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
 - The contestants that used the trebuchet was either the group that made it to 150 ft or the Flying Eyes.
 - If the Flying Eyes made 135 ft (from Step 1), they cannot be using the trebuchet. Thus, the trebuchet team made 150 ft.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
 - The group that used the catapult landed 30 feet short of the team that used the slingshot.
 - This means the catapult team made 135 ft and the slingshot team made 165 ft.
 
 Step 5: Analyze Clue 4
 - The Spud Chuckers landed somewhat short of the Yukon Bolds.
 - Since the only remaining distances are 165 ft and 180 ft, Spud Chuckers must be 165 ft and Yukon Bolds 180 ft.
 
 Step 6: Assign remaining options
 - From Step 2, if Russets are 180 ft, then hybrid sling must be 135 ft.
 - From Step 3, trebuchet is 150 ft.
 - From Step 4, catapult is 135 ft and slingshot is 165 ft.
 - From Step 5, Spud Chuckers are 165 ft and Yukon Bolds are 180 ft.
 - Flying Eyes must be 135 ft (from Step 1).
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 135 ft | Flying Eyes | catapult
 150 ft | Russets | trebuchet
 165 ft | Spud Chuckers | slingshot
 180 ft | Yukon Bolds | hybrid sling","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 5
- It states that the hybrid sling and the Russets scored either 180 ft or 135 ft. This means the other distances (150 ft and 165 ft) are not possible for these two.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- The team that made it to 135 ft was either the Flying Eyes or the contestants that used the hybrid sling. Since the hybrid sling is linked to either 135 ft or 180 ft from Clue 5, it's possible that the hybrid sling could be the device used for 135 ft.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
- The trebuchet was used by either the team that made it to 150 ft or the Flying Eyes. Since we don't have enough information yet to decide, we keep this in mind for later.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- The catapult landed 30 feet short of the slingshot. This means the distances for the catapult and slingshot must be consecutive in the list of distances (135 ft, 150 ft, 165 ft, 180 ft).

Step 5: Analyze Clue 4
- The Spud Chuckers landed somewhat short of the Yukon Bolds. This means the Spud Chuckers did not achieve the longest distance, and the Yukon Bolds did not achieve the shortest.

Step 6: Deduce from Clues 2, 4, and 5
- If the hybrid sling is at 135 ft, then from Clue 5, the Russets must be at 180 ft. This fits as it leaves 150 ft and 165 ft for the remaining teams and devices.
- From Clue 2, if the catapult is 30 ft shorter than the slingshot, and considering the remaining distances, the catapult must be at 135 ft and the slingshot at 165 ft. This fits with the hybrid sling being at 135 ft.

Step 7: Place the Teams
- Since the Russets are at 180 ft and the hybrid sling is at 135 ft, the Flying Eyes must be at 150 ft using the trebuchet (from Clue 1).
- This leaves the Spud Chuckers at 165 ft with the slingshot, and the Yukon Bolds at 180 ft with the catapult.

Final Answer:
135 ft | Flying Eyes | hybrid sling
150 ft | Russets | trebuchet
165 ft | Spud Chuckers | slingshot
180 ft | Yukon Bolds | catapult

130 | correct option from names | correct option from linkedin
140 | correct option from names | correct option from linkedin
150 | correct option from names | correct option from linkedin
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 ""The person with 84 LinkedIn connections is either the person with 150 Facebook friends or Vickie.""
 This means that the person with 84 LinkedIn connections must be linked to either 150 Facebook friends or be Vickie.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
 ""Of the one with 150 Facebook friends and the one with 130 Facebook friends, one is Yvonne and the other has 84 LinkedIn connections.""
 From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we can deduce that the person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections, and the person with 130 Facebook friends is Yvonne.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
 ""Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari.""
 This means Danny and Kari must have consecutive Facebook friend counts from the available options (120, 130, 140, 150). Since 150 is taken by the person with 84 LinkedIn connections and 130 is taken by Yvonne, Danny and Kari must be between 120 and 140. Since Danny has more friends, Danny has 140 and Kari has 120.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 ""The one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections.""
 This means the person with 57 LinkedIn connections must have 130 Facebook friends, but since Yvonne has 130 Facebook friends, this clue must be reinterpreted. The only remaining options for LinkedIn connections are 57 and 70. Since 130 Facebook friends are taken by Yvonne, the next possible pair is 120 and 140. Therefore, the person with 140 Facebook friends has 57 LinkedIn connections, and the person with 120 Facebook friends has 70 LinkedIn connections.
 
 Step 5: Assign Remaining Names and LinkedIn Connections
 From the above deductions:
 - Yvonne has 130 Facebook friends and the remaining LinkedIn option is 64.
 - Vickie, by elimination, has 120 Facebook friends and 70 LinkedIn connections.
 - Danny has 140 Facebook friends and 57 LinkedIn connections.
 - Kari, by elimination, has 150 Facebook friends and 84 LinkedIn connections.
 
 Final Answer:
 120 | Vickie | 70
 130 | Yvonne | 64
 140 | Danny | 57
 150 | Kari | 84","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person with 84 LinkedIn connections is either the person with 150 Facebook friends or Vickie.
- This implies two possibilities: 
  - Vickie has 84 LinkedIn connections, or
  - The person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the one with 150 Facebook friends and the one with 130 Facebook friends, one is Yvonne and the other has 84 LinkedIn connections.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we can deduce:
  - If the person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections, then Yvonne must have 130 Facebook friends.
  - If Vickie has 84 LinkedIn connections, she cannot have 150 Facebook friends, so she must have a different number of Facebook friends.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari.
- This means Danny and Kari must be assigned to Facebook friend counts that are 20 apart (e.g., 120 and 140, or 130 and 150).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections.
- This sets a specific relationship between the Facebook friends of those with 57 and 70 LinkedIn connections.

**Step 5: Deductions and Assignments**
- Since Yvonne and the person with 84 LinkedIn connections are tied to 150 and 130 Facebook friends, and Danny and Kari have a 20 difference, Danny and Kari cannot be 150 or 130. They must be 120 and 140 or vice versa.
- If Danny has more Facebook friends than Kari, and they are 20 apart, Danny must be 140 and Kari 120.
- This leaves 150 for Yvonne and 130 for Vickie.
- Assign LinkedIn connections based on remaining clues and previous deductions:
  - Yvonne (150 Facebook) cannot have 84 LinkedIn (as Vickie or the person with 150 Facebook has 84, and Vickie is not Yvonne), so Vickie must have 84 LinkedIn and 130 Facebook.
  - Danny (140 Facebook) and Kari (120 Facebook) must fit the remaining LinkedIn connections of 57 and 70. Since the one with 57 LinkedIn has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn, Danny must have 57 LinkedIn and Kari 70 LinkedIn.

August 23rd | correct option from companies | correct option from positions
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 4, the Zathdrill interview is 2 days after the Haytouch interview. This means if Haytouch is on August 20th, Zathdrill would be on August 22nd. If Haytouch is on August 21st, Zathdrill would be on August 23rd.
 
 2. From Clue 1, the Haytouch interview is 2 days before the graphic design position interview. If Haytouch is on August 20th, the graphic design interview would be on August 22nd. If Haytouch is on August 21st, the graphic design interview would be on August 23rd.
 
 3. From Clue 2, either the social media position or the Laneplex interview is on August 23rd, and the other is on August 20th. Since we know from Clue 1 and 4 that Haytouch and Zathdrill occupy August 20th and August 22nd respectively, and graphic design is on August 23rd, Laneplex must be on August 20th and social media on August 23rd.
 
 4. From Clue 3, the janitor position is sometime after the Streeter Inc. interview. Since Streeter Inc. cannot be on August 23rd (as it's occupied by social media), and it cannot be on August 20th (occupied by Laneplex), it must be on August 21st or August 22nd. If Streeter Inc. is on August 21st, the janitor position must be on August 22nd or August 23rd. Since graphic design is on August 23rd, the janitor position must be on August 22nd.
 
 5. Now, we know:
  - August 20th: Laneplex, not yet determined position
  - August 21st: Streeter Inc., not yet determined position
  - August 22nd: Zathdrill, janitor
  - August 23rd: Haytouch, graphic design

 Final Answer:
 August 20th | Laneplex | social media
 August 21st | Streeter Inc. | tech support
 August 22nd | Zathdrill | janitor
 August 23rd | Haytouch | graphic design","Step-by-step solution:

1. **Analyzing Clue 1**: The Haytouch interview is 2 days before the interview for the graphic design position.
   - This means there must be a 1-day gap between Haytouch and graphic design interviews.

2. **Analyzing Clue 4**: The Zathdrill interview is 2 days after the Haytouch interview.
   - This sets a fixed sequence: Haytouch, then 2 days later, Zathdrill.

3. **Combining Clues 1 and 4**: Since Haytouch and Zathdrill are separated by 2 days, and Haytouch is 2 days before the graphic design interview, the only possible arrangement that fits all days of the week is:
   - Haytouch on August 20th, Zathdrill on August 22nd, and graphic design on August 23rd.

4. **Analyzing Clue 2**: Of the interview for the social media position and the Laneplex interview, one is on August 23rd and the other is on August 20th.
   - Since August 20th is already taken by Haytouch, Laneplex must be on August 20th, and the social media position must be on August 23rd.

5. **Analyzing Clue 3**: The meeting for the janitor position is sometime after the Streeter Inc. interview.
   - Since August 20th and 23rd are occupied by Laneplex and social media respectively, and August 22nd is taken by Zathdrill, Streeter Inc. must be on August 21st. Consequently, the janitor position must be on August 22nd.

6. **Filling Remaining Slots**:

 1. From Clue 1, the Friambliss was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir. This means the pinot noir cannot be the earliest vintage (1984) since there would be no earlier year for Friambliss.
 
 2. From Clue 2, the 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein. 
 
 3. From Clue 3, the Ece Suss is either the 1992 bottle or the 1996 wine.
 
 4. From Clue 4, of the pinot gris and the 1984 wine, one is the Annata Branco and the other is the Friambliss. This means neither the pinot gris nor the 1984 wine can be the Ece Suss or the Zifennwein.
 
 5. From Clue 5, the Zifennwein was bottled 4 years after the pinot gris. This means the pinot gris must be either 1984 or 1988, and the Zifennwein must be either 1988 or 1992.
 
 6. Since the Zifennwein must be either 1988 or 1992, and the 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein, the Zifennwein cannot be the 1996 wine. Therefore, the 1996 wine must be the syrah.
 
 7. Since the 1996 wine is the syrah, and the Ece Suss is either the 1992 or 1996 wine, the Ece Suss must be the 1992 wine.
 
 8. Since the Ece Suss is the 1992 wine, and the Zifennwein is 4 years after the pinot gris, the pinot gris must be 1988 and the Zifennwein must be 1992.
 
 9. Since the pinot gris is 1988 and one of the pinot gris or the 1984 wine is the Annata Branco, the Annata Branco must be the 1984 wine.
 
 10. Since the Annata Branco is the 1984 wine and the Friambliss is the other option from Clue 4, the Friambliss must be the pinot gris and thus the 1988 wine.
 
 11. Since the Friambliss is the 1988 wine and was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir (Clue 1), the pinot noir must be the 1992 wine.
 
 12. The only remaining vintage is 1996, which we already determined is the syrah, and the only remaining wine is the Zifennwein, which must be the 1992 wine.
 
 Final Answer:
 1984 | Annata Branco | pinot noir
 1988 | Friambliss | pinot gris
 1992 | Ece Suss | gewurztraminer
 1996 | Zifennwein | syrah","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- The 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Ece Suss is either the 1992 bottle or the 1996 wine.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Zifennwein was bottled 4 years after the pinot gris. This means the Zifennwein cannot be the 1996 wine (as it would require the pinot gris to be 1992, conflicting with Clue 3 where Ece Suss could be 1992). Therefore, the 1996 wine must be the syrah, and Zifennwein is not 1996.

**Step 4: From Step 3**
- Since the 1996 wine is syrah, and Zifennwein is not 1996, by Clue 2, Zifennwein must be a different year.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the pinot gris and the 1984 wine, one is the Annata Branco and the other is the Friambliss. 

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 1**
- The Friambliss was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir. Since Friambliss is either 1984 or pinot gris from Clue 4, and it precedes pinot noir by 4 years, pinot noir cannot be 1988 (as it would imply Friambliss is 1984, leaving no room for pinot gris in 1984). Thus, Friambliss must be pinot gris, and Annata Branco is 1984.

**Step 7: From Step 6**
- Since Friambliss is pinot gris, and it precedes pinot noir by 4 years, pinot noir must be 1992 (as 1988 + 4 = 1992).

**Step 8: From Step 3 and Step 7**
- Since Ece Suss is either 1992 or 1996, and 1992 is pinot noir, Ece Suss must be 1996.

**Step 9: From Step 5 and Step 8**
- Since Annata Branco is 1984, and Friambliss is pinot gris, Friambliss must be 1988.

**Step 10: From Step 4 and Step 9**
- Since Zifennwein is not 1996 and must be 4 years after pinot gris (1988), Zifennwein must be 1992.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.

| Year | Wine          | Type           |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1984 | Annata Branco | (not determined yet) |

members : 23, 26, 29, 32.
fraternities : Alpha Beta Tau, Beta Pi Omega, Sigma Beta, Tau Beta Pi.
streets : Aspen Court, Boom Court, Norwood Street, Russell Road.

Clues:
1. The fraternity on Boom Court has 3  fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau.
2. Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or the frat on Aspen Court.
3. Beta Pi Omega has 3  more members than Alpha Beta Tau.
4. Of Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road, one has 23 members and the other has 29 members.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
23 | correct option from fraternities | correct option from streets
26 | correct option from fraternities | correct option from streets
29 | correct option from fraternities | correct option from streets
32 | correct option from fraternities | correct option from streets
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze the clues
 - Clue 1: The fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau.
 - Clue 2: Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or the frat on Aspen Court.
 - Clue 3: Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau.
 - Clue 4: Of Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road, one has 23 members and the other has 29 members.
 
 Step 2: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 1
 - Since Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau, and the fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau, we can set up a relationship:
  Let Alpha Beta Tau = x members,
  Then, Beta Pi Omega = x + 3 members,
  And the fraternity on Boom Court = x - 3 members.
 
 Step 3: Use the member numbers to fit the clues
 - The possible member numbers are 23, 26, 29, and 32.
 - If Alpha Beta Tau = 26 (middle value to allow for both +3 and -3),
  Then, Beta Pi Omega = 29,
  And the fraternity on Boom Court = 23.
 
 Step 4: Apply Clue 2
 - Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or on Aspen Court.
 - Since the fraternity on Boom Court has 23 members, and if we assume Tau Beta Pi = 23 members, then Tau Beta Pi is on Boom Court.
 
 Step 5: Apply Clue 4
 - Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road are either 23 or 29 members.
 - Since Tau Beta Pi (23 members) is on Boom Court, Sigma Beta cannot be 23 members.
 - Therefore, Sigma Beta = 29 members and is on Russell Road.
 
 Step 6: Remaining fraternity and street
 - The remaining fraternity is Alpha Beta Tau with 26 members.
 - The remaining street for Alpha Beta Tau is Norwood Street (since Aspen Court is either Tau Beta Pi or not, and Boom Court and Russell Road are taken).
 
 Step 7: Assign the remaining options
 - Beta Pi Omega = 29 members, and since Sigma Beta is on Russell Road, Beta Pi Omega must be on Aspen Court.
 
 Final Answer:
 23 | Tau Beta Pi | Boom Court
 26 | Alpha Beta Tau | Norwood Street
 29 | Beta Pi Omega | Aspen Court
 32 | Sigma Beta | Russell Road","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 3**
- Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau.

From Steps 1 and 2, we can infer that:
- If Alpha Beta Tau has \( x \) members, then Beta Pi Omega has \( x + 3 \) members, and the fraternity on Boom Court has \( x - 3 \) members.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or the frat on Aspen Court.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road, one has 23 members and the other has 29 members.

**Step 5: Deduce from Clues 1, 2, 3, and 4**
- Since Tau Beta Pi could be the house with 23 members or on Aspen Court, and considering the member counts from Clues 1 and 3, we can start assigning possible member counts to fraternities:
  - If Alpha Beta Tau has 26 members (a middle value that allows for both increases and decreases as per Clues 1 and 3), then:
    - Beta Pi Omega would have 29 members.
    - The fraternity on Boom Court would have 23 members.
  - This setup allows Tau Beta Pi to be either 23 members or on Aspen Court.

**Step 6: Assigning Streets**
- Since the fraternity on Boom Court has 23 members, and Tau Beta Pi could be 23 members, Tau Beta Pi fits on Boom Court if it's not on Aspen Court.
- Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road are either 23 or 29 members. Since 29 members are taken by Beta Pi Omega, Sigma Beta must be 23 members and on Russell Road.

**Step 7: Remaining Assignments**
- The only remaining street for Alpha Beta Tau is Norwood Street.
- The only remaining fraternity for 32 members is the one not yet assigned, which must be on Aspen Court.

### Final Answer:
- Fill the following table to show your final answer.

| Members | Fraternity      | Street         |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| 23      | Tau Beta Pi     | Boom Court     |

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1525 | correct option from shrines | correct option from towns
1585 | correct option from shrines | correct option from towns
1645 | correct option from shrines | correct option from towns
1705 | correct option from shrines | correct option from towns
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
 - The temple in Nakai was built 60 years after Yamasaki. This means Yamasaki must be built 60 years before the temple in Nakai.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
 - Matsuno Okura was built 60 years after the shrine in Nakai. This means Matsuno Okura is built 60 years after the temple in Nakai.
 
 Step 3: Determine the years for Yamasaki, Nakai, and Matsuno Okura
 - Since there are only four years (1525, 1585, 1645, 1705) and Matsuno Okura is built 120 years after Yamasaki (60 years after Nakai which is 60 years after Yamasaki), the only possible sequence that fits is:
  - Yamasaki in 1525
  - Nakai in 1585
  - Matsuno Okura in 1645
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
 - Of Takahashi and the temple in Uchida, one was built in 1525 and the other in 1705. Since Yamasaki is already in 1525, Takahashi or the temple in Uchida must be in 1705. The remaining year for the other is 1705.
 
 Step 5: Assign the remaining shrine and town
 - The only remaining year is 1705, and the only remaining shrine is Takahashi, and the only remaining town is Uchida.
 
 Step 6: Analyze Clue 1
 - The structure in Niwa is either Amari Michi or Yamasaki. Since Yamasaki is already in 1525, Amari Michi must be in Niwa.
 
 Final Answer:
 1525 | Yamasaki | Niwa
 1585 | Amari Michi | Nakai
 1645 | Matsuno Okura | Usui
 1705 | Takahashi | Uchida","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
- ""The temple in Nakai was built 60 years after Yamasaki.""
- This implies that Yamasaki must be built 60 years before the temple in Nakai.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
- ""Matsuno Okura was built 60 years after the shrine in Nakai.""
- Since the temple in Nakai is 60 years after Yamasaki, and Matsuno Okura is 60 years after Nakai, Matsuno Okura is 120 years after Yamasaki.

Step 3: Determine possible years for Yamasaki
- Since Yamasaki is followed by Nakai (60 years later) and then Matsuno Okura (another 60 years later), Yamasaki cannot be later than 1645 because there must be 120 years available after it for the other two shrines.
- If Yamasaki is in 1525, then Nakai is in 1585, and Matsuno Okura is in 1705.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
- ""Of Takahashi and the temple in Uchida, one was built in 1525 and the other was built in 1705.""
- Since Matsuno Okura is in 1705, Takahashi cannot be in 1705. Therefore, Takahashi must be in 1525 and the temple in Uchida must be in 1705.

Step 5: Assign remaining shrine and town
- The remaining year is 1645, which must be assigned to Amari Michi.
- The remaining town is Usui.

Step 6: Review Clue 1
- ""The structure in Niwa is either Amari Michi or Yamasaki.""
- Since Yamasaki is already assigned to 1525 and not in Niwa, Amari Michi must be in Niwa.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
March | correct option from dogs | correct option from officers
April | correct option from dogs | correct option from officers
May | correct option from dogs | correct option from officers
June | correct option from dogs | correct option from officers
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 - Of the K-9 unit assigned to Officer Yates and the canine that graduated in May, one was Jaws and the other was Hercules. This means Jaws and Hercules are either assigned to Yates or graduated in May, but not both.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 - Aries graduated sometime after Jaws. This means Jaws cannot be in June, and Aries cannot be in March.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 - The dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman. This sets a specific sequence with a two-month gap between Nolan's and Zimmerman's dogs.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 - The dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell. This means Tinkerbell cannot be in March, and Fox's dog cannot be in June.
 
 Step 5: Deductions and Assignments
 - Since Jaws and Hercules are linked to Yates and May, and Aries must be after Jaws, Aries cannot be in May. If Jaws were in May, Aries would have to be in June, but that would leave no room for Hercules to be in May or assigned to Yates. Thus, Hercules must be in May.
 - Since Hercules is in May, Yates must be assigned to Jaws (from Clue 1). Jaws cannot be in May, so Jaws must be assigned to Yates in another month.
 - Since Aries is after Jaws and Jaws is linked to Yates, Aries cannot be with Yates. Aries must be in June (the only month left after May for Aries).
 - Since Nolan's dog is 2 months before Zimmerman's, and Tinkerbell is after Fox's dog, Tinkerbell fits best in June, but since Aries is already placed in June, Tinkerbell must be in another month. Thus, Tinkerbell is in April.
 - Nolan's dog must then be in March and Zimmerman's in May. Since Hercules is in May, Zimmerman is assigned to Hercules.
 - The only dog left for March is Jaws, and since Yates is with Jaws, Yates is in March.
 - Fox's dog, being before Tinkerbell and not being Jaws or Hercules, must be Aries in June.
 
 Final Answer:
 March | Jaws | Yates
 April | Tinkerbell | Nolan
 May | Hercules | Zimmerman
 June | Aries | Fox","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that between Officer Yates and the dog graduating in May, one is paired with Jaws and the other with Hercules. This doesn't specify the exact month or officer for each dog yet, but it sets a relationship.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that Aries graduated sometime after Jaws. This means Jaws cannot be in June, and Aries cannot be in March.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman. This means if Nolan's dog graduated in March, Zimmerman's must be in May; if Nolan's is in April, Zimmerman's is in June.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that the dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell. This means Fox's dog cannot be in June, and Tinkerbell cannot be in March.

**Step 5: Deductions from Clues**
- From Clue 3 and Clue 4, if Zimmerman's dog is in May or June, and Tinkerbell is not in March, Tinkerbell could be Zimmerman's dog in May or June. If Zimmerman is in May, then Nolan must be in March. This fits as Fox cannot be in June (Clue 4), and Tinkerbell cannot be in March.

**Step 6: Placement of Jaws and Hercules**
- From Clue 1, if Yates is paired with one of Jaws or Hercules and the other is in May, and considering the placement from Step 5, if Zimmerman is in May with Tinkerbell, then Yates cannot be in May. Thus, Yates must be with Jaws or Hercules in another month. Since Jaws must be before Aries (Clue 2) and Aries cannot be in March, Jaws cannot be in June. If Jaws is in March, then Hercules must be in May.

**Step 7: Assign Remaining Slots**
- Jaws is in March with Yates (from Step 6 and Clue 1). Hercules is in May (from Step 6). Aries is after Jaws and cannot be in March or May, so Aries must be in June. The remaining dog, Tinkerbell, must be in April.
- Nolan's dog is 2 months before Zimmerman's. If Zimmerman is in May with Tinkerbell, Nolan must be in March. The remaining officer for June is Fox.

**Final Answer:**
- Fill the table based on deductions:

| Month  | Dog         | Officer    |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| March  | Jaws        | Yates      |

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
50 | correct option from planners | correct option from events
75 | correct option from planners | correct option from events
100 | correct option from planners | correct option from events
125 | correct option from planners | correct option from events
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 2
 - Clue 1 states that the symposium event will involve 25 more people than Clarence's assignment.
 - Clue 2 states that of the symposium job and the graduation assignment, one will be handled by Mabel and the other will have 125 attendees.
 
 Step 2: Deduce from Clue 1 and Clue 2
 - If the symposium has 25 more people than Clarence's assignment, and one of the symposium or graduation has 125 attendees, Clarence cannot be assigned to the symposium (as it would require a negative number of attendees for his assignment). Therefore, Clarence must be assigned to an event with fewer than 125 attendees.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5
 - Clue 4 states that the assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job.
 - Clue 5 states that Patrice's assignment will involve 50 more people than the retreat assignment.
 
 Step 4: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 5
 - Clue 3 states that the retreat job will involve somewhat fewer people than the graduation job.
 - Since Patrice's assignment involves 50 more people than the retreat, and the retreat has fewer people than the graduation, the retreat cannot have 125 attendees.
 
 Step 5: Assign specific numbers
 - If the symposium has 125 attendees (from Clue 2), and Clarence's assignment has 25 fewer people, Clarence must be assigned to the event with 100 attendees.
 - Since the symposium has 125 attendees and one of the symposium or graduation is handled by Mabel, Mabel must handle the symposium (as Clarence is handling the 100 attendees event).
 
 Step 6: Assign remaining events and people
 - Since the retreat has fewer attendees than the graduation (Clue 3), and the retreat cannot have 125 attendees, the retreat must have 75 attendees.
 - Patrice's assignment, which is 50 more than the retreat, must then be the graduation with 125 attendees.
 - The only remaining number for attendees is 50, which must be the conference.
 
 Step 7: Assign remaining planners
 - Since Mabel is handling the symposium (125 attendees), Clarence is handling the 100 attendees event, and Patrice is handling the graduation (125 attendees), the only remaining planner, Glenda, must handle the conference (50 attendees).
 
 Final Answer:
 50 | Glenda | conference
 75 | Mabel | retreat
 100 | Clarence | symposium
 125 | Patrice | graduation","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The symposium event will involve 25 more people than Clarence's assignment.
- This means Clarence's event cannot have 125 people, as no option allows for 150 attendees.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
- Of the symposium job and the graduation assignment, one will be handled by Mabel and the other will have 125 attendees.
- Since symposium has 25 more people than Clarence's event, symposium cannot have 125 attendees. Therefore, the graduation must have 125 attendees.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
- The retreat job will involve somewhat fewer people than the graduation job.
- Since graduation has 125 attendees, retreat must have fewer than 125 attendees.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
- The assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job.
- Since Mabel is handling either symposium or graduation (from Clue 2) and graduation has 125 attendees, Mabel must be handling the symposium. Therefore, the conference must have 50 attendees.

Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
- Patrice's assignment will involve 50 more people than the retreat assignment.
- Since retreat has fewer than 125 attendees, and the only remaining options for attendees are 50, 75, and 100, retreat must have 75 attendees (as 50 is for the conference and 100 would make Patrice's event 150, which is not an option).

Step 6: Assign remaining numbers
- Since retreat has 75 attendees and Patrice's event has 50 more, Patrice's event must have 125 attendees.
- Since graduation has 125 attendees and is not handled by Patrice, it must be handled by someone else.
- Since Mabel handles the symposium and not the graduation, and Clarence cannot handle the symposium (from Clue 1), Clarence must handle the retreat.
- The remaining planner for the graduation is Glenda.

Step 7: Assign remaining events
- Since conference has 50 attendees and is not handled by Mabel or Patrice, it must be handled by the remaining planner, which is Patrice.
- Since Clarence handles the retreat with 75 attendees, the remaining event for Mabel's symposium must be 100 attendees.

Final Answer:
50 | Patrice | conference

animals : cat, dog, monkey, snail.
colors : gold, orange, red, yellow.

Clues:
1. The monkey cost  more than the gold animal.
2. Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red.
3. The dog cost 1 dollar more than the yellow piece.
4. The snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.
5. The yellow balloon cost 2 dollars less than the red balloon.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$3.00 | correct option from animals | correct option from colors
$4.00 | correct option from animals | correct option from colors
$5.00 | correct option from animals | correct option from colors
$6.00 | correct option from animals | correct option from colors
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze the clues
 - Clue 4 states that the snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.
 
 Step 2: Use Clue 5
 - The yellow balloon cost $2 less than the red balloon. This means the price difference between the yellow and red balloon is $2.
 
 Step 3: Use Clue 3
 - The dog cost $1 more than the yellow balloon. This helps us link the price of the dog to the yellow balloon.
 
 Step 4: Use Clue 2
 - Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red. This helps us determine the color of the $6.00 balloon and the cat.
 
 Step 5: Use Clue 1
 - The monkey cost more than the gold animal. This helps us determine the relative price of the monkey and the gold-colored balloon.
 
 Step 6: Deduce from Clues
 - Since the snail is either $6.00 or $3.00 (Clue 4), and the yellow balloon is $2 less than the red balloon (Clue 5), we can start assigning prices:
  - If the red balloon is $6.00, then the yellow balloon must be $4.00 (since $6.00 - $2.00 = $4.00).
  - The dog costs $1 more than the yellow balloon (Clue 3), so the dog must be $5.00.
  - The snail, therefore, must be $3.00 since it can only be $6.00 or $3.00 and $6.00 is taken by the red balloon.
 
 Step 7: Assign remaining prices and animals
 - The monkey must be the $6.00 balloon since it costs more than the gold animal (Clue 1) and the only price left higher than $5.00 is $6.00.
 - The cat must then be the $4.00 balloon.
 
 Step 8: Assign colors
 - The $6.00 balloon is red (from Clue 2 and Step 6).
 - The yellow balloon is $4.00, so the cat is yellow.
 - The dog is $5.00, and the only color left for it is gold (since the monkey is more expensive than the gold animal, it can't be gold).
 - The snail is $3.00, and the only color left is orange.
 
 Final Answer:
 $3.00 | snail | orange
 $4.00 | cat | yellow
 $5.00 | dog | gold
 $6.00 | monkey | red","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- The snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The yellow balloon cost 2 dollars less than the red balloon.
  - This means the price difference between the yellow and red balloon is $2.00.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The dog cost 1 dollar more than the yellow piece.
  - Since the yellow balloon is $2.00 less than the red balloon, and the prices are $3.00, $4.00, $5.00, $6.00, the yellow balloon cannot be $6.00 or $3.00 (as $3.00 + $1.00 = $4.00, which is possible, but $6.00 + $1.00 = $7.00, which is not a listed price). Thus, yellow must be $3.00 or $4.00.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red.
  - Since we know the red balloon is $2.00 more than the yellow balloon, if yellow is $3.00, red must be $5.00. If yellow is $4.00, red must be $6.00.

**Step 5: Combine Clues 3 and 5**
- If yellow is $3.00, then red is $5.00. The dog, costing $1.00 more than the yellow balloon, would be $4.00.
- If yellow is $4.00, then red is $6.00. The dog, costing $1.00 more than the yellow balloon, would be $5.00. But this conflicts with the red balloon's price, so yellow must be $3.00, red is $5.00, and the dog is $4.00.

**Step 6: Revisit Clue 4**
- Since the snail is either $6.00 or $3.00, and yellow is $3.00, the snail cannot be yellow. Thus, the snail must be $6.00.

**Step 7: Revisit Clue 1**
- The monkey cost more than the gold animal.
  - Since the snail is $6.00, it cannot be gold (as no price is higher than $6.00). The remaining prices for the monkey are $5.00 (already taken by red) or $4.00 (taken by the dog). Thus, the monkey must be $3.00, and it cannot be gold either.

**Step 8: Finalize Colors and Animals**
- The remaining animal for $5.00 (red) is the cat.
- The remaining color for $3.00 (yellow) is the monkey.
- The remaining color for $6.00 (snail) must be either orange or gold. Since the cat is red and the dog is yellow, the snail must be orange (as per Clue 2, the cat or $6.00 balloon is orange/red).
- The remaining color for $4.00 (dog) is gold.

### Final Answer:
$3.00 | monkey | yellow  
$4.00 | dog | gold  
$5.00 | cat | red  
$6.00 | snail | orange

Clues:
1. The calculus textbook costs 5 dollars more than the title written by Velma Vintz.
2. The textbook written by Velma Vintz costs 10 dollars less than the textbook written by Tara Tyne.
3. The field theory title costs  more than the title written by Mina Morton.
4. Of the algebra book and the $39.99 title, one was written by Pat Peterson and the other was written by Tara Tyne.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, Velma Vintz's book costs $10 less than Tara Tyne's book. This means that if Velma's book is $24.99, Tara's must be $34.99; if Velma's is $29.99, Tara's must be $39.99.
 
 2. From Clue 1, the calculus book costs $5 more than Velma Vintz's book. If Velma's book is $24.99, calculus would be $29.99; if Velma's book is $29.99, calculus would be $34.99.
 
 3. From Clue 5, the pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99. Since Tara Tyne's book could be $34.99 or $39.99, and the pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99, Tara cannot have written the pre-calculus book.
 
 4. From Clue 4, either the algebra book or the $39.99 book was written by Pat Peterson or Tara Tyne. Since Tara's book could be $34.99 or $39.99, and the pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99, Tara must have written the $39.99 book, which is not pre-calculus. Therefore, Tara wrote the algebra book, and it costs $39.99.
 
 5. Since Tara wrote the algebra book at $39.99, the pre-calculus book must be $24.99. This leaves $29.99 and $34.99 for calculus and field theory.
 
 6. From Clue 3, the field theory book costs more than Mina Morton's book. Since calculus is $5 more than Velma's book, and Velma's book is either $24.99 or $29.99, calculus must be $29.99 or $34.99. If calculus is $29.99, Velma's book is $24.99, and Mina's book must be less than the field theory book, which would then be $34.99.
 
 7. This setup means Velma's book is $24.99, calculus is $29.99, field theory is $34.99, and algebra is $39.99. Mina Morton's book must be the field theory book at $34.99, as it is the only one left that fits the price pattern.
 
 Final Answer:
 $24.99 | pre-calculus | Velma Vintz
 $29.99 | calculus | Pat Peterson
 $34.99 | field theory | Mina Morton
 $39.99 | algebra | Tara Tyne","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2**
- Velma Vintz's book costs $10 less than Tara Tyne's book.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- The calculus book costs $5 more than Velma Vintz's book.

**Step 3: Combine Clues 1 and 2**
- If Velma's book costs $10 less than Tara's, and calculus costs $5 more than Velma's, then calculus cannot be the most expensive or the cheapest. Therefore, calculus must be either $29.99 or $34.99.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 5**
- The pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the algebra book and the $39.99 title, one was written by Pat Peterson and the other by Tara Tyne. Since pre-calculus could be $39.99, algebra cannot be $39.99. Therefore, algebra must be cheaper than $39.99.

**Step 6: Deduce from Clue 3**
- The field theory title costs more than the title written by Mina Morton. Since field theory costs more, it cannot be the cheapest. 

**Step 7: Deduce Prices**
- Since calculus is either $29.99 or $34.99, and field theory costs more than Mina Morton's book, Mina cannot have written the field theory book. If Mina wrote a cheaper book, it could be $24.99 or $29.99.

**Step 8: Place Tara Tyne and Pat Peterson**
- Since Tara Tyne and Pat Peterson are associated with the algebra book and the $39.99 title, and pre-calculus could be $39.99, Tara Tyne must have written the $39.99 book, which is pre-calculus. Pat Peterson must have written the algebra book.

**Step 9: Assign Remaining Prices**
- Since Tara Tyne's book is $10 more than Velma's, and Tara's is $39.99, Velma's must be $29.99. Calculus, costing $5 more than Velma's, must be $34.99.

**Step 10: Assign Remaining Fields and Authors**
- Velma Vintz wrote the calculus book at $34.99.
- Mina Morton, with a cheaper book than field theory, must have written the algebra book at $29.99.
- The only remaining field for the $24.99 book is field theory, written by the remaining author, Pat Peterson.

14 | correct option from tortoises | correct option from species
32 | correct option from tortoises | correct option from species
50 | correct option from tortoises | correct option from species
68 | correct option from tortoises | correct option from species
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, Methuselah is 32 years old. We can fill this in the table.
  32 | Methuselah | -
 
 2. Clue 2 states that the two rimmed tortoise is 36 years older than the horned tortoise. Since the ages available are 14, 32, 50, and 68, and the difference must be 36 years, the only possible ages for these tortoises are 14 (horned) and 50 (two rimmed) or 32 (horned) and 68 (two rimmed). Since Methuselah is already 32 and not a two rimmed tortoise, the horned tortoise must be 14 and the two rimmed tortoise must be 50.
  14 | - | horned
  50 | - | two rimmed
 
 3. Clue 3 states that Chewie is either the pitch belly tortoise or the 50-year-old one. Since the 50-year-old tortoise is the two rimmed tortoise, Chewie must be the pitch belly tortoise.
  - | Chewie | pitch belly
 
 4. Clue 4 states that of the black neck tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise, one is 68 years old and the other is named Shelly. Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, the black neck tortoise must be 68 years old and Shelly must be the name of the two rimmed tortoise.
  68 | - | black neck
  50 | Shelly | two rimmed
 
 5. Now, we know:
  - Methuselah is 32 and not assigned a species.
  - Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise.
  - Shelly is 50 years old and the two rimmed tortoise.
  - The black neck tortoise is 68 years old.
  - The horned tortoise is 14 years old.
 
  Since Methuselah is 32 and not assigned a species, and the only species left is the horned tortoise, Methuselah must be the horned tortoise.
  32 | Methuselah | horned
 
 6. The only tortoise and age left unassigned are Yoda and 14. So, Yoda is 14 years old.
  14 | Yoda | -
 
 7. The only species left for Yoda is pitch belly, but Chewie is already the pitch belly tortoise. Since Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise, Yoda must be the black neck tortoise, and the 68-year-old tortoise must be the pitch belly tortoise. This corrects the earlier assumption.
  68 | - | pitch belly
  14 | Yoda | black neck
 
 8. The only tortoise left for 68 years old is Chewie.
  68 | Chewie | pitch belly
 
 Final Answer:
 14 | Yoda | black neck
 32 | Methuselah | horned
 50 | Shelly | two rimmed
 68 | Chewie | pitch belly","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Apply Clue 1
Methuselah is 32 years old.
- 32 | Methuselah | ?

Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The two rimmed tortoise is 36 years older than the horned tortoise.
- Since the ages available are 14, 32, 50, and 68, and the difference must be 36 years, the only possible ages for the horned tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise are 14 and 50, or 32 and 68. Since Methuselah is 32 and not a species, the horned tortoise must be 14 and the two rimmed tortoise 50.
- 14 | ? | horned
- 50 | ? | two rimmed

Step 3: Apply Clue 3
Chewie is either the pitch belly tortoise or the 50-year-old one.
- Since the 50-year-old tortoise is the two rimmed tortoise, Chewie cannot be 50 years old. Therefore, Chewie must be the pitch belly tortoise.
- ? | Chewie | pitch belly

Step 4: Apply Clue 4
Of the black neck tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise, one is 68 years old and the other is named Shelly.
- Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, the black neck tortoise must be 68 years old. Shelly must be the name of the two rimmed tortoise.
- 68 | ? | black neck
- 50 | Shelly | two rimmed

Step 5: Assign Remaining Options
- Methuselah is 32 and not associated with a species yet.
- Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise, but we don't know the age.
- Yoda is the remaining tortoise to be placed.

From the remaining options:
- Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise, and the only ages left for Chewie are 14 or 68. Since 68 is taken by the black neck tortoise, Chewie must be 14.
- 14 | Chewie | pitch belly
- This leaves Yoda to be 68 years old.
- 68 | Yoda | black neck

Final Answer:
14 | Chewie | pitch belly
