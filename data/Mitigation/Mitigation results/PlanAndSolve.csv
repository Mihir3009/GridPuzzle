341.json,"Nicholas and Edith are having a small dinner party this evening at their home in Cedar Valley, and they've decided to open a select number of rare wines from their personal collection to celebrate the occasion. Using only the clues below, match the vintages to the options from wines and types. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

vintages : 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996.
wines : Annata Branco, Bianca Flaux, Ece Suss, Vendemmia.
types : gewurztraminer, merlot, pinot noir, riesling.

Clues:
1. The Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.
2. The Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia.
3. The 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.
4. The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.
5. The Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.
6. The 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1984 | correct option from wines | correct option from types
1988 | correct option from wines | correct option from types
1992 | correct option from wines | correct option from types
1996 | correct option from wines | correct option from types
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 6, we know that the 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer. This information will be used to eliminate gewurztraminer from other years.
 
 2. From clue 3, the 1988 bottle is a pinot noir. This information will be used to eliminate pinot noir from other years.
 
 3. From clue 4, the merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux. This means Ece Suss and Vendemmia cannot be merlot.
 
 4. From clue 1, the Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco. This means Annata Branco cannot be the latest year (1996) and Ece Suss cannot be the earliest year (1984).
 
 5. From clue 5, the Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss. This means Bianca Flaux cannot be the earliest year (1984) and must be later than Ece Suss.
 
 6. From clue 2, the Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This helps us place these two wines in consecutive years that are 4 years apart.
 
 7. Since the Bianca Flaux must be after the Ece Suss and 4 years before the Vendemmia, and considering the years available (1984, 1988, 1992, 1996), the only arrangement that fits is:
  - Ece Suss in 1988 or 1992
  - Bianca Flaux in 1992
  - Vendemmia in 1996
 
 8. Since the 1988 bottle is pinot noir, and Ece Suss is the only option left for 1988, Ece Suss must be pinot noir.
 
 9. Since the 1984 bottle is gewurztraminer and the only wine left for 1984 is Annata Branco, Annata Branco must be gewurztraminer.
 
 10. Since Bianca Flaux is in 1992 and the only type left for 1992 is merlot (as per clue 4), Bianca Flaux must be merlot.
 
 11. The only remaining year and type for Vendemmia is 1996 and riesling.
 
 Final Answer:
 1984 | Annata Branco | gewurztraminer
 1988 | Ece Suss | pinot noir
 1992 | Bianca Flaux | merlot
 1996 | Vendemmia | riesling","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Facts**
- From Clue 6: The 1984 bottle is a gewurztraminer.
- From Clue 3: The 1988 bottle is a pinot noir.

**Step 2: Use Direct Clues**
- From Clue 2: The Bianca Flaux was bottled 4 years before the Vendemmia. This means if Bianca Flaux is 1992, then Vendemmia is 1996.
- From Clue 5: The Bianca Flaux was bottled sometime after the Ece Suss.
- From Clue 1: The Ece Suss was bottled sometime after the Annata Branco.

**Step 3: Process of Elimination**
- Since the 1984 bottle is gewurztraminer and the 1988 bottle is pinot noir, the remaining types for 1992 and 1996 are merlot and riesling.
- From Clue 4: The merlot is either the Annata Branco or the Bianca Flaux.

**Step 4: Cross-Verification**
- Since the Bianca Flaux is after the Ece Suss and the Ece Suss is after the Annata Branco, the only possible sequence that fits is Annata Branco -> Ece Suss -> Bianca Flaux -> Vendemmia.
- Given the sequence and the years between Bianca Flaux and Vendemmia (4 years), and knowing the years of the wines, we can assign:
  - Annata Branco to 1984 (gewurztraminer)
  - Ece Suss to 1988 (pinot noir)
  - Bianca Flaux to 1992 (merlot)
  - Vendemmia to 1996 (riesling)

first | correct option from roses | correct option from gardeners
second | correct option from roses | correct option from gardeners
third | correct option from roses | correct option from gardeners
fourth | correct option from roses | correct option from gardeners
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 3, we know that the altissimo won fourth place. From clue 1, we know that the rose that won fourth place was Hannah's. Therefore, Hannah's rose is altissimo and it won fourth place.
 
 2. From clue 2, we know that the flower that won second place, the calocarpa, and the bon silene were all different flowers. Since altissimo is already in fourth place, it cannot be any of these flowers.
 
 3. From clue 4, the bon silene finished 1 place ahead of Tricia's rose. From clue 5, the bon silene finished 2 places ahead of Nellie's flower. This means bon silene must be in first place, Tricia's rose in second place, and Nellie's rose in third place.
 
 4. Since the bon silene is in first place and different from calocarpa (clue 2), and Tricia's rose is in second place, Tricia's rose must be calocarpa.
 
 5. Since Nellie's rose is in third place and it cannot be bon silene or calocarpa, and altissimo is already taken by Hannah, the only remaining option for Nellie's rose is perle d'or.
 
 6. The only remaining gardener for the first place (bon silene) is Renee.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 first | bon silene | Renee
 second | calocarpa | Tricia
 third | perle d'or | Nellie
 fourth | altissimo | Hannah","Step-by-step solution:
- From clue 3, the altissimo won fourth place.
- From clue 1, the rose that won fourth place was Hannah's. Since altissimo is in fourth place, it belongs to Hannah.
- From clue 2, the flower that won second place, the calocarpa, and the bon silene were all different flowers. Since altissimo is already in fourth place, it cannot be any of these.
- From clue 4, the bon silene finished 1 place ahead of Tricia's rose. Since bon silene and Tricia's rose are consecutive, and bon silene is not second or fourth (from clue 2 and altissimo being fourth), bon silene must be third and Tricia's rose second.
- From clue 5, the bon silene finished 2 places ahead of Nellie's flower. Since bon silene is third, Nellie's flower must be first.
- Since calocarpa is different from the second and third place flowers (from clue 2), and altissimo is fourth, calocarpa must be first.
- The remaining rose, perle d'or, must be second.
- Since Nellie's flower is first and calocarpa is first, Nellie's rose is calocarpa.
- Since Tricia's rose is second and perle d'or is second, Tricia's rose is perle d'or.
- The remaining gardener for the third place (bon silene) is Renee.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

341.json,"A standardized test has recently been developed that is now used to determine the general effectiveness of any form of A. I.  (Artificial Intelligence).   A series of different A. I.  systems, each named after a different person in Ancient Greek history, has recently been scored according to this test.   Using only the clues below, match each A. I. Using only the clues below, match the scores to the options from a.i. and institutions. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

scores : 55%, 62%, 69%, 76%.
a.i. : Archimedes, Galen, Proclus, Zeno.
institutions : CIT, Exeter, Oxford, UCLA.

Clues:
1. Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA.
2. Galen scored 62%.
3. The A.I. that scored 76% was either Galen or the system from Oxford.
4. Proclus scored 76%.

55% | correct option from a.i. | correct option from institutions
62% | correct option from a.i. | correct option from institutions
69% | correct option from a.i. | correct option from institutions
76% | correct option from a.i. | correct option from institutions
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 4, Proclus scored 76%. This eliminates Proclus from other scores and 76% from other A.I. options.
 2. From clue 2, Galen scored 62%. This eliminates Galen from other scores and 62% from other A.I. options.
 3. From clue 3, since Proclus scored 76%, Galen cannot be the one who scored 76%. Therefore, the system from Oxford scored 76%.
 4. From clue 5, the system that scored 55% was either from CIT or Zeno. Since Zeno is an A.I. and not an institution, this clue must mean that either Zeno scored 55% or the system from CIT scored 55%.
 5. From clue 1, Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA. Since Zeno cannot be 76% (Proclus is 76%) and cannot be 62% (Galen is 62%), Zeno must be either 55% or 69%. If Zeno were 55%, there would be no score 7% lower than 55% for UCLA. Therefore, Zeno must be 69%, and UCLA must be 62%.
 6. Since Zeno is 69%, the only remaining score for 55% must be associated with the remaining A.I., which is Archimedes. Since CIT was an option for 55%, Archimedes is from CIT.
 7. The only remaining institution for Proclus (76%) is Exeter, as Oxford is already taken by the 76% score.
 
 Final Answer:
 55% | Archimedes | CIT
 62% | Galen | UCLA
 69% | Zeno | Oxford
 76% | Proclus | Exeter","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4**
- Clue 2 states that Galen scored 62%.
- Clue 4 states that Proclus scored 76%.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that the A.I. that scored 76% was either Galen or the system from Oxford. Since Galen scored 62%, it must be Proclus from Oxford who scored 76%.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- Clue 5 states that the system that scored 55% was either the system from CIT or Zeno. Since Proclus is from Oxford and Galen scored 62%, we need to determine between Zeno and the remaining institution for the 55% score.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that Zeno finished with a score that was 7 percent higher than that of the system from UCLA. Since UCLA cannot be 76% (Proclus, Oxford) or 62% (Galen), UCLA must be associated with either 55% or 69%. If UCLA were 55%, Zeno would be 62%, but Galen is already 62%. Therefore, UCLA must be 69%, and Zeno must be 76%.

**Step 5: Assign Remaining Scores and Institutions**
- Since Zeno is 76% and associated with Oxford, and Proclus is also 76% but already assigned to Oxford, Zeno must be from another institution. Since UCLA is 69%, the remaining institution for Zeno is CIT.
- The system from CIT scored 55% as per Clue 5, and since Zeno is 76%, the system from CIT must be Archimedes.

**Step 6: Finalize the Table**
- Galen scored 62% and is not from Oxford or UCLA, so Galen must be from Exeter.
- The remaining score of 55% goes to Archimedes from CIT.
- Proclus is 76% from Oxford.
- Zeno is 76% from CIT.
- The system from UCLA scored 69% and must be the remaining A.I., which is Archimedes.

2. Tracy's letter was sent in 1962.
3. The bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive.

1983 | correct option from writers | correct option from origins
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, Tracy's letter was sent in 1962. This gives us the first entry in our table.
 
 2. From Clue 5, Sean's bottle was from Le Havre. This means Sean did not send the bottle from Plymouth or Cherbourg.
 
 3. From Clue 4, Sean's missive is either the letter that was sent in 1983 or the message that was sent in 1962. Since Tracy's letter was sent in 1962, Sean's letter must have been sent in 1983. This also means Sean's letter is from Le Havre.
 
 4. From Clue 1, the message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg. This means if we add 14 years to the year the letter from Cherbourg was sent, we get the year the Plymouth letter was sent. The possible years for sending are 1962, 1969, 1976, and 1983. If Cherbourg's letter was sent in 1969, Plymouth's would be sent in 1983, but since 1983 is already taken by Sean's letter from Le Havre, Cherbourg's letter must have been sent in 1962, and Plymouth's in 1976. However, since Tracy's letter from 1962 is already identified and not from Cherbourg, Cherbourg's letter must be sent in another year. The only option left that fits is Cherbourg in 1969 and Plymouth in 1983. But since Sean's letter from Le Havre is in 1983, this is incorrect. Re-evaluating, Cherbourg must be in 1969 and Plymouth in 1983, but Sean's letter from Le Havre is in 1983. Thus, Cherbourg must be in 1962 and Plymouth in 1976.
 
 5. From Clue 3, the bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive. Since Tracy's letter is from 1962, Karla's must be from Plymouth in 1976.
 
 6. The remaining writer for 1969 from Cherbourg is Felipe, as Sean is in 1983 and Tracy in 1962, and Karla is in 1976.
 
 Final Answer:

### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Apply Clue 2**
- Tracy's letter was sent in 1962.
  - 1962 | Tracy | ?

**Step 2: Apply Clue 5**
- Sean's bottle was from Le Havre.
  - ? | Sean | Le Havre

**Step 3: Apply Clue 4**
- Sean's missive is either the letter that was sent in 1983 or the message that was sent in 1962.
  - Since Tracy's letter was sent in 1962, Sean's letter must be sent in 1983.
  - 1983 | Sean | Le Havre

**Step 4: Apply Clue 1**
- The message from Plymouth was sent 14 years after the letter from Cherbourg.
  - Since we don't know the exact years yet, we'll keep this in mind for later.

**Step 5: Apply Clue 3**
- The bottle from Plymouth is either Karla's bottle or Tracy's missive.
  - Since Tracy's letter was sent in 1962 and not from Plymouth, Karla's bottle must be from Plymouth.
  - ? | Karla | Plymouth

**Step 6: Apply Clue 1 with Known Information**
- Since Karla's bottle is from Plymouth, and it must be 14 years after Cherbourg, we need to find a year that fits this rule.
  - If Cherbourg was in 1969, Plymouth would be in 1983. But since 1983 is taken by Le Havre, this is incorrect.
  - If Cherbourg was in 1962, Plymouth would be in 1976. This fits as 1976 is available.
  - 1976 | Karla | Plymouth
  - 1962 | Tracy | Cherbourg

**Step 7: Fill in Remaining Gaps**
- We have left 1969 and 1983 for origins and Felipe for writers.
  - Since 1983 is taken by Sean and Le Havre, and 1962 and 1976 are taken by Tracy/Cherbourg and Karla/Plymouth respectively, Felipe must be in 1969.
  - The only origin left for 1969 is Bournemouth.
  - 1969 | Felipe | Bournemouth

Clues:
1. The outing to Eastbrook logged 7 fewer shooting stars than the trip to Isleton.
2. The April 17 outing was in Gilmore City.

2 | correct option from dates | correct option from locations
9 | correct option from dates | correct option from locations
16 | correct option from dates | correct option from locations
23 | correct option from dates | correct option from locations
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze the clues
 - Clue 2 states that the April 17 outing was in Gilmore City.
 - Clue 3 states that the outing where they saw 16 shooting stars was in Gilmore City.
 
 From these two clues, we can deduce that on April 17, they saw 16 shooting stars in Gilmore City.
 
 Step 2: Use the remaining clues
 - Clue 4 states that the April 10 outing logged 7 more shooting stars than the April 22 outing.
 
 Since we know the number of shooting stars on April 17 is 16, we need to find two numbers from the remaining options (2, 9, 23) where one is 7 more than the other. The only numbers that fit this criterion are 9 and 2. Therefore, on April 10, they saw 9 shooting stars, and on April 22, they saw 2 shooting stars.
 
 Step 3: Use the first clue
 - Clue 1 states that the outing to Eastbrook logged 7 fewer shooting stars than the trip to Isleton.
 
 The only remaining number of shooting stars is 23. Since 23 is 7 more than 16, and 16 is already used for Gilmore City on April 17, 23 must be the number of shooting stars seen in Isleton. Since Eastbrook must have 7 fewer stars than Isleton, and the only number left is 2, Eastbrook must be the location where they saw 2 shooting stars.
 
 Step 4: Assign the remaining date and location
 - The only remaining date is April 7, and the only remaining location is Manchester. Since 9 shooting stars were seen on April 10 and the location for that date hasn't been assigned yet, Manchester must be the location for April 10.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 2 | April 22 | Eastbrook
 9 | April 10 | Manchester
 16 | April 17 | Gilmore City
 23 | April 7 | Isleton","Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 2, we know that the April 17 outing was in Gilmore City.
2. From Clue 3, the outing where they saw 16 shooting stars was in Gilmore City. Combining this with Clue 2, the outing on April 17 saw 16 shooting stars in Gilmore City.

3. From Clue 4, the April 10 outing logged 7 more shooting stars than the April 22 outing. Since we know the numbers of shooting stars are 2, 9, 16, and 23, and 16 is already used on April 17, the only way to have a difference of 7 is between 9 and 2 or 23 and 16. Since 16 is already used on April 17, April 10 must have 9 shooting stars and April 22 must have 2 shooting stars.

4. From Clue 1, the outing to Eastbrook logged 7 fewer shooting stars than the trip to Isleton. Since we have 2 and 9 left for the shooting stars and 16 is already used, the only remaining numbers are 2 and 23. Since 2 is already used on April 22, Eastbrook must have 2 shooting stars and Isleton must have 9 shooting stars.

5. Now, we can fill in the remaining details:
   - Since Eastbrook has 2 shooting stars and April 22 also has 2 shooting stars, Eastbrook is the location for April 22.
   - Since Isleton has 9 shooting stars and April 10 also has 9 shooting stars, Isleton is the location for April 10.
   - The only remaining date and location for the 23 shooting stars is April 7 and Manchester.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 1, Underwood is in room 114.
 2. From clue 2, the guest in room 320 is staying 1 day fewer than Underwood. We need to determine Underwood's stay duration to use this clue.
 3. From clue 3, Owens is staying for 3 days.
 4. From clue 4, Parker is staying 1 day longer than the guest in room 314. We need to determine the stay duration of the guest in room 314 to use this clue.
 
 Let's analyze the days:
 - We have days 2, 3, 4, and 5 to assign.
 - Owens is staying for 3 days (clue 3).
 
 Now, let's assign rooms:
 - Underwood is in room 114 (clue 1).
 - We need to find out who is in rooms 124, 314, and 320.
 
 Using clue 2, since the guest in room 320 stays 1 day fewer than Underwood, we need to find Underwood's stay duration:
 - If Underwood stays for 4 days, then the guest in room 320 stays for 3 days. But Owens is already staying for 3 days, so this is not possible.
 - If Underwood stays for 5 days, then the guest in room 320 stays for 4 days. This is possible and does not conflict with any other information.
 
 So, Underwood stays for 5 days in room 114.
 
 Using clue 4, Parker stays 1 day longer than the guest in room 314:
 - If the guest in room 314 stays for 2 days, Parker stays for 3 days. But Owens is already staying for 3 days, so this is not possible.
 - If the guest in room 314 stays for 3 days, Parker stays for 4 days. This fits well with the remaining days and does not conflict with any other information.
 
 So, Parker stays for 4 days, and the guest in room 314 (Zamora, the only guest left) stays for 3 days.
 
 Now, the only guest and room left are Zamora and room 124, and the only day left is 2 days. So, Zamora stays in room 124 for 2 days.
 
 Final Answer:
 2 | Zamora | 124
 3 | Owens | 314
 4 | Parker | 320
 5 | Underwood | 114","Step-by-step solution:
1. From clue 1, Underwood is in room 114.
2. From clue 3, Owens is staying for 3 days.
3. From clue 4, Parker is staying 1 day longer than the guest in room 314. We need to find the stay duration of the guest in room 314 to use this clue.
4. Since Owens is staying for 3 days, and Parker stays 1 day longer than the guest in room 314, room 314 cannot be 3 days (as Parker would then be 4 days, which is not an option). Therefore, room 314 must be either 2 or 4 days.
5. If room 314 is 2 days, Parker would be 3 days, but Owens is already staying for 3 days. Thus, room 314 must be 4 days, and Parker, staying 1 day longer, must be 5 days.
6. From clue 2, the guest in room 320 is staying 1 day fewer than Underwood. Since Underwood is in room 114 and the guest in room 320 stays 1 day fewer, if we assign Underwood 5 days, room 320 would be 4 days. But room 314 is already 4 days, so Underwood must be 4 days, making room 320 3 days.
7. The guest in room 320 for 3 days must be Owens (since Owens stays for 3 days).
8. The only remaining day is 2, and the only remaining guest is Zamora, and the only remaining room is 124.

341.json,"A group of friends has decided to try several different weight-loss diets and exercises to see who amongst them can lose the most weight in 3 months. Using only the clues below, match the pounds lost to the options from names and diets. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

pounds lost : 3, 5, 7, 9.
names : Raymond, Stuart, Tom, Wesley.
diets : caveman, dairy-free, gluten-free, vegan.

Clues:
1. Stuart lost 4 more pounds than the person who used the vegan diet.
2. The dieter who used the gluten-free diet lost 2 more pounds than Raymond.
3. Stuart lost 7 lbs.
4. The dieter who lost 7 lbs is either the person who used the caveman diet or Raymond.
5. Wesley lost 5 lbs.

3 | correct option from names | correct option from diets
5 | correct option from names | correct option from diets
7 | correct option from names | correct option from diets
9 | correct option from names | correct option from diets
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, we know Stuart lost 7 lbs.
 2. From Clue 4, since Stuart lost 7 lbs, he must be on the caveman diet or be Raymond. But since Stuart and Raymond are different people, Stuart must be on the caveman diet.
 3. From Clue 5, Wesley lost 5 lbs.
 4. From Clue 1, Stuart lost 4 more pounds than the person on the vegan diet. Since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet lost 3 lbs.
 5. From Clue 2, the person on the gluten-free diet lost 2 more pounds than Raymond. We need to find out how much Raymond lost to determine the weight loss of the person on the gluten-free diet.
 6. Since the pounds lost are 3, 5, 7, and 9, and we know Stuart lost 7 lbs, Wesley lost 5 lbs, and the vegan diet resulted in a 3 lb loss, the only remaining number for pounds lost is 9 lbs. This must be the weight loss for the person on the gluten-free diet.
 7. Since the gluten-free dieter lost 9 lbs and this is 2 more than Raymond, Raymond must have lost 7 lbs. However, since Stuart already lost 7 lbs, Raymond must have lost a different amount. Revisiting the clues, we realize that Raymond must have lost 5 lbs, but Wesley already lost 5 lbs. Therefore, Raymond must have lost 3 lbs, and the vegan diet person lost 3 lbs. This means Raymond is on the vegan diet.
 8. The only remaining diet is dairy-free, which must be Wesley's diet since all other diets are accounted for.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 3 | Raymond | vegan
 5 | Wesley | dairy-free
 7 | Stuart | caveman
 9 | Tom | gluten-free","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Values from Clues**
- From Clue 3, Stuart lost 7 lbs.
- From Clue 5, Wesley lost 5 lbs.

**Step 2: Use Deductive Reasoning**
- From Clue 1, since Stuart lost 7 lbs, the person on the vegan diet must have lost 7 - 4 = 3 lbs.
- From Clue 4, since Stuart lost 7 lbs and the clue states that the person who lost 7 lbs is either the person who used the caveman diet or Raymond, and since Stuart is not Raymond, Stuart must be on the caveman diet.
- From Clue 2, since the gluten-free dieter lost 2 more pounds than Raymond, we need to find Raymond's weight loss to use this clue.

**Step 3: Eliminate Conflicts and Fill Remaining Slots**
- Since Stuart lost 7 lbs and is on the caveman diet, and Wesley lost 5 lbs, the remaining pounds lost are 3 and 9.
- Since the vegan diet corresponds to 3 lbs (from Step 2), and Wesley lost 5 lbs, Wesley cannot be on the vegan diet.
- Since Stuart is not Raymond and he lost 7 lbs, Raymond must have lost either 3 or 9 lbs. From Clue 2, the gluten-free dieter lost more than Raymond, so Raymond cannot have lost 9 lbs. Therefore, Raymond lost 3 lbs, and the gluten-free dieter lost 5 lbs.
- Since Wesley lost 5 lbs and the gluten-free dieter lost 5 lbs, Wesley followed the gluten-free diet.
- The remaining pounds lost (9 lbs) must be associated with Tom, and the only diet left is dairy-free.

**Step 4: Verify Consistency**
- Check all clues with the final arrangement to ensure no contradictions.

prices : $45, $60, $75, $90.
winners : Otis, Phillip, Walter, Yvette.
butterflies : atlas, grayling, peacock, swallowtail.

Clues:
1. Yvette's purchase was either the insect that sold for $45 or the peacock butterfly.
2. The swallowtail butterfly cost 15 dollars more than Phillip's purchase.
3. The atlas butterfly cost  more than the peacock butterfly.
4. The four butterflies were the butterfly that sold for $90, the grayling butterfly, Yvette's purchase and Walter's purchase.

$45 | correct option from winners | correct option from butterflies
$60 | correct option from winners | correct option from butterflies
$75 | correct option from winners | correct option from butterflies
$90 | correct option from winners | correct option from butterflies
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 Yvette's purchase was either the insect that sold for $45 or the peacock butterfly. This means Yvette either bought the $45 butterfly or the peacock butterfly.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 The swallowtail butterfly cost $15 more than Phillip's purchase. This means Phillip's butterfly cost $15 less than the swallowtail.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 The atlas butterfly cost more than the peacock butterfly. This means the atlas butterfly is not the cheapest.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 The four butterflies were the butterfly that sold for $90, the grayling butterfly, Yvette's purchase, and Walter's purchase. This means these are the only options for the butterflies and their prices.
 
 Step 5: Deduce from Clues
 From Clue 1 and Clue 4, if Yvette's purchase was the peacock and not the $45 butterfly, then the $45 butterfly must be another option. Since the atlas costs more than the peacock, the atlas cannot be the cheapest. Therefore, Yvette must have bought the $45 butterfly or the peacock butterfly. If Yvette bought the peacock, it cannot be the cheapest or the most expensive ($90), so it must be either $60 or $75.
 
 Step 6: Further Deduction
 Since the swallowtail costs $15 more than Phillip's purchase, and the atlas costs more than the peacock, the atlas must be the $90 butterfly. This leaves the grayling and swallowtail to be either $60 or $75. Since the swallowtail is $15 more than Phillip's purchase, if Phillip's purchase was $60, the swallowtail would be $75. But since the atlas is $90, Phillip's purchase must be $75 - $15 = $60, making the swallowtail $75.
 
 Step 7: Assign Remaining Prices and Winners
 Phillip bought a butterfly for $60, and the swallowtail is $75. Walter's purchase is the only one left, which must be the grayling butterfly. Since the atlas is $90 and more expensive than the peacock, the peacock must be $60. Therefore, Yvette bought the $45 butterfly, which is not the peacock, leaving the only option for $45 as the grayling.
 
 Final Answer:
 $45 | Yvette | grayling
 $60 | Phillip | peacock
 $75 | Walter | swallowtail
 $90 | Otis | atlas","Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 1, Yvette's purchase was either the insect that sold for $45 or the peacock butterfly. This means Yvette did not buy the butterfly that sold for $60, $75, or $90.

2. From Clue 2, the swallowtail butterfly cost $15 more than Phillip's purchase. This clue will be used later to determine the exact prices once we have more information.

3. From Clue 3, the atlas butterfly cost more than the peacock butterfly. This sets a hierarchy in pricing between these two butterflies.

4. From Clue 4, the four butterflies were the butterfly that sold for $90, the grayling butterfly, Yvette's purchase, and Walter's purchase. This clue confirms that Walter did not buy the butterfly that sold for $45 if that was Yvette's purchase.

Let's start solving:
1. Since Yvette's purchase was either $45 or the peacock, and the peacock must cost less than the atlas (from Clue 3), we can deduce that Yvette bought the butterfly for $45, as the peacock cannot be the cheapest option.

2. Since the swallowtail costs $15 more than Phillip's purchase (from Clue 2), and we know the prices are $45, $60, $75, and $90, we need to find a fit. If Phillip bought the butterfly for $60, then the swallowtail would cost $75.

3. From Clue 3, since the atlas costs more than the peacock and the swallowtail is $75, the atlas must be $90, as it is the only higher price left.

4. From Clue 4, since Walter's purchase is listed and Yvette bought the $45 butterfly, Walter must have bought either the $60, $75, or $90 butterfly. Since the atlas is $90 and costs more than the peacock, Walter must have bought the atlas.

5. Since the swallowtail is $75 and Phillip's purchase leads to the swallowtail being $15 more, Phillip must have bought the butterfly for $60.

6. The remaining butterfly, the peacock, must then be the remaining price, which is $75. Since Phillip bought the $60 butterfly, Otis must have bought the peacock for $75.

June 11 | correct option from names | correct option from departures
June 12 | correct option from names | correct option from departures
June 13 | correct option from names | correct option from departures
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze the clues
 - Clue 3 states that Eugene will depart from Farley.
 - Clue 1 states that the person departing from Farley will leave 2 days before the person departing from Hardwick.
 
 Step 2: Assign Eugene and Farley
 - Since Eugene departs from Farley, we can place Eugene and Farley together.
 
 Step 3: Determine the days for Farley and Hardwick
 - From Clue 1, since Farley departs 2 days before Hardwick, and knowing Eugene is at Farley, we need to find a suitable day for Eugene that allows another day for Hardwick exactly 2 days later.
 
 Step 4: Place Eugene and Farley
 - If Eugene (Farley) departs on June 10, then Hardwick would be on June 12.
 
 Step 5: Use Clue 4
 - The conductor departing from Epworth will leave 1 day after Mitchell.
 - Since we know the days for Farley and Hardwick, Mitchell cannot be on June 10 or June 12. If Mitchell is on June 11, then Epworth would be on June 12, but June 12 is already taken by Hardwick. Thus, Mitchell must be on June 13, and Epworth on June 14, which is not possible as we only have days up to June 13. Therefore, Mitchell must be on June 10, and Epworth on June 11.
 
 Step 6: Assign remaining names and places
 - We have placed Eugene (Farley on June 10), Mitchell (Epworth on June 11), and Hardwick (June 12). The only remaining name is Roderick and the only remaining departure is Jackman, which must be on June 13.
 
 Step 7: Assign the remaining conductor
 - From Clue 2, the four conductors are the conductor departing from Farley, the conductor working on June 11, Mitchell, and Roderick. Since we know Mitchell is on June 10 and Roderick is on June 13, the conductor on June 11 must be Allen.
 
 Final Answer:
 June 10 | Eugene | Farley
 June 11 | Allen | Epworth
 June 12 | Mitchell | Hardwick
 June 13 | Roderick | Jackman","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Understand and Apply Direct Clues**
- Clue 3 states that Eugene will depart from Farley. This gives us a direct name and departure match.

**Step 2: Apply Clue 1**
- Since Eugene departs from Farley, and according to Clue 1, the person departing from Farley leaves 2 days before the person departing from Hardwick, we can determine the relative days for these departures.

**Step 3: Create and Fill the Grid**
- We know Eugene departs from Farley. We need to find a suitable day for Eugene that allows the person departing from Hardwick to leave 2 days later.

**Step 4: Deduce Relationships Using Remaining Clues**
- Clue 4 states that the conductor departing from Epworth will leave 1 day after Mitchell. This helps us place Mitchell and the Epworth departure relative to each other.

**Step 5: Check for Possible Days**
- Since there are only four days (June 10, June 11, June 12, June 13), and Eugene (departing from Farley) needs to leave 2 days before the Hardwick departure, Eugene cannot depart on June 12 or June 13 (as this would not leave room for a 2-day gap). Thus, Eugene must depart on June 10 or June 11.

**Step 6: Finalize the Grid**
- If Eugene departs on June 10 from Farley, then the Hardwick departure must be on June 12.
- Mitchell cannot be on June 12 since the Epworth departure is the day after Mitchell. Thus, Mitchell must be on June 11, and the Epworth departure on June 12.
- This leaves June 13 for the last departure, which is Jackman, and the only remaining conductor, Roderick.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 and Clue 4
 - Kurt Koch is the defensive end (Clue 3).
 - Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker (Clue 4).
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 - The person who played in 5 games last season is the quarterback.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
 - Edward Ellis played 2 more games than the defensive end.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 5
 - The running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games last season.
 
 Step 5: Deduce the number of games each player played
 - Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end and Edward Ellis played 2 more games than him, and considering the games available (3, 4, 5, 6), Kurt Koch must have played fewer games than Edward Ellis.
 - If Kurt Koch played 3 games (the minimum), Edward Ellis must have played 5 games (3 + 2 = 5). This fits with Clue 2, where the quarterback played 5 games. Therefore, Edward Ellis is the quarterback.
 
 Step 6: Determine the placekicker
 - Since Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker, and Kurt played 3 games, the placekicker played 5 games. But since Edward Ellis (the quarterback) played 5 games, this is not possible. Therefore, Kurt Koch must have played 4 games, and the placekicker played 6 games.
 
 Step 7: Assign the remaining player and position
 - The only remaining game number is 3, and the only remaining player is Gordon Gregg or Jack Jensen. Since the running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games (Clue 5), and Kurt Koch (defensive end) played 4 games, Gordon Gregg must be the running back who played 3 games.
 - Jack Jensen is the remaining player and must be the placekicker who played 6 games.
 
 Final Answer:
 3 | Gordon Gregg | running back
 4 | Kurt Koch | defensive end
 5 | Edward Ellis | quarterback
 6 | Jack Jensen | placekicker","Step-by-step solution:
1. **From Clue 3**: Kurt Koch is the defensive end.
2. **From Clue 4**: Kurt Koch played 2 fewer games than the placekicker. Since games are 3, 4, 5, 6, Koch must have played one of these minus 2.
3. **From Clue 2**: The person who played in 5 games is the quarterback. This sets one game and position.
4. **From Clue 1**: Edward Ellis played 2 more games than the defensive end. Since Koch is the defensive end, we need to find his game number to determine Ellis's.
5. **From Clue 5**: The running back is either Gordon Gregg or the person who played in 4 games. This clue will be used later to confirm the identity once more positions are set.

Using these clues:
- Since Kurt Koch is the defensive end and played 2 fewer games than the placekicker, and the quarterback played 5 games, Koch cannot have played 5. If Koch played 3 games (the lowest), the placekicker played 5 games. But since the quarterback is already in game 5, Koch must have played in 4 games, making the placekicker in game 6.
- Edward Ellis, playing 2 more games than Koch (defensive end), must have played in 6 games.
- The quarterback played in 5 games, and since Edward Ellis is in game 6 and Koch in game 4, Jack Jensen must be the quarterback in game 5.
- The remaining game (3) and position (running back) must then be filled by Gordon Gregg, as per Clue 5.

January | correct option from owners | correct option from dog breeds
February | correct option from owners | correct option from dog breeds
March | correct option from owners | correct option from dog breeds
April | correct option from owners | correct option from dog breeds
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, we know Violet's pet is the boxer.
 2. From Clue 2, Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu. This means the shih tzu was adopted in either January or February, and Kayla's pet was adopted in either March or April.
 3. From Clue 3, Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab. This means the black lab was adopted in either February, March, or April, and Rosie's pet was adopted in either January, February, or March.
 4. From Clue 4, we know that the four puppies are Rosie's pet, the dog adopted in April, the puppy adopted in February, and the puppy adopted in March. This means Rosie's pet is not the dog adopted in April.
 
 Let's start placing the information:
 - Violet has the boxer.
 - Rosie's pet is not the dog adopted in April.
 
 Since Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab, and the black lab cannot be adopted in January (as it would mean Rosie's pet was adopted in December, which is not listed), the earliest Rosie's pet can be adopted is February, and the black lab in March. This fits as Rosie's pet is one of the puppies, and the puppy adopted in March is also a puppy.
 
 This leaves:
 - Rosie's pet adopted in February.
 - Black lab adopted in March.
 
 Since Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu, and the shih tzu cannot be adopted in March (as it would mean Kayla's pet was adopted in May, which is not listed), the shih tzu must be adopted in January, and Kayla's pet in March.
 
 This leaves:
 - Shih tzu adopted in January.
 - Kayla's pet (unknown breed) adopted in March.
 
 Since Violet has the boxer and the boxer is not listed as adopted in March or January (as those slots are filled by the shih tzu and Kayla's pet), Violet's boxer must be adopted in April.
 
 This leaves:
 - Violet with the boxer in April.
 
 The only remaining slot is for Lydia, and the only remaining breed is the schnauzer, which must be adopted in February.
 
 Final Answer:
 January | Lydia | shih tzu
 February | Rosie | schnauzer
 March | Kayla | black lab
 April | Violet | boxer","Step-by-step solution:
- From clue 1, Violet has a boxer.
- From clue 2, Kayla's pet was adopted 2 months after the shih tzu. This means the shih tzu was adopted in either January or February, as the latest Kayla's pet could be adopted is April.
- From clue 3, Rosie's pet was adopted 1 month before the black lab. This means the black lab was adopted in either February, March, or April.
- From clue 4, Rosie's pet, the dog adopted in April, the puppy adopted in February, and the puppy adopted in March are all different. This means Rosie's pet is not adopted in February, March, or April.

Let's start placing the information:
- Since Rosie's pet is not adopted in February, March, or April, Rosie's pet must be adopted in January.
- Since the black lab is adopted 1 month after Rosie's pet (clue 3), the black lab is adopted in February.
- Since Kayla's pet is adopted 2 months after the shih tzu, and the shih tzu cannot be adopted in March (as that would place Kayla's pet in May, which is not an option), the shih tzu must be adopted in January, and Kayla's pet in March.
- Since Violet has the boxer (clue 1), and the boxer cannot be the pet adopted in January (as it's Rosie's pet), February (as it's the black lab), or March (as it's Kayla's pet), Violet's boxer must be adopted in April.
- This leaves Lydia with the remaining month, February, and the remaining dog breed, schnauzer.

341.json,"The California condor  is one of the world's largest and most endangered birds.   Several conservation programs have been raising and releasing condors into the wild in an effort to boost their numbers. Using only the clues below, match the wingspans to the options from names and ages. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

wingspans : 102 inches, 106 inches, 110 inches, 114 inches.
names : Angel, Buddy, Gracie, Smokey.
ages : 8, 9, 11, 12.

Clues:
1. Gracie is 11 years old.
2. The four condors are the 9-year-old condor, the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches, Buddy and the condor with a wingspan of 110 inches.
3. The 11-year-old condor has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old bird.
4. The 9-year-old condor is either the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches or Angel.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, Gracie is 11 years old.
 2. From Clue 3, the 11-year-old condor (Gracie) has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old bird.
 3. From Clue 5, the condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 12 years old.
 4. From Clue 4, the 9-year-old condor is either the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches or Angel. Since the 114-inch wingspan bird is 12 years old (from Clue 5), the 9-year-old must be Angel.
 5. From Clue 2, the four condors are the 9-year-old condor (Angel), the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches, Buddy, and the condor with a wingspan of 110 inches.
 6. Since Gracie is 11 years old and her wingspan is 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old's (Angel), and since Angel cannot have a wingspan of 114 inches (as it belongs to the 12-year-old), Angel must have a wingspan of 110 inches. Therefore, Gracie's wingspan is 106 inches (110 - 4).
 7. The remaining wingspan of 102 inches must belong to Buddy, as he is one of the four mentioned in Clue 2 and not yet assigned a wingspan.
 8. The only remaining age and wingspan combination is for Smokey, who must be 12 years old with a wingspan of 114 inches.
 
 Final Answer:
 102 inches | Buddy | 8
 106 inches | Gracie | 11
 110 inches | Angel | 9
 114 inches | Smokey | 12","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Information**
- From Clue 1: Gracie is 11 years old.
- From Clue 5: The condor with a wingspan of 114 inches is 12 years old.

**Step 2: Use Deductive Reasoning**
- From Clue 3: The 11-year-old condor (Gracie) has a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old bird. Since the 11-year-old is Gracie, we need to find the wingspan of the 9-year-old and subtract 4 inches for Gracie.
- From Clue 4: The 9-year-old condor is either the bird with a wingspan of 114 inches or Angel. But from Clue 5, the 114-inch wingspan bird is 12 years old, so the 9-year-old must be Angel.
- Since Angel is the 9-year-old, and Gracie is 11 years old with a wingspan 4 inches shorter than the 9-year-old, we need to find the wingspan of Angel (9 years old) that allows for this difference.
- From Clue 2: The four condors are the 9-year-old condor, the bird with a wingspan of 102 inches, Buddy, and the condor with a wingspan of 110 inches. Since Angel is the 9-year-old, Angel cannot have a wingspan of 102 inches or 110 inches.
- Since Angel is 9 years old and cannot have the wingspans of 102 or 110 inches, and 114 inches is for the 12-year-old, Angel must have a wingspan of 106 inches. Therefore, Gracie (11 years old) must have a wingspan of 106 - 4 = 102 inches.

**Step 3: Fill Remaining Information**
- Buddy must be either the bird with a wingspan of 110 inches or 102 inches. Since Gracie is already assigned to 102 inches, Buddy must have a wingspan of 110 inches.
- The remaining wingspan, 114 inches, is already assigned to a 12-year-old, and the remaining name is Smokey.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, we know that the Disty launched in March.
 2. From Clue 4, we know that the Iunsel is going to Pluto.
 3. From Clue 5, the Iunsel launched 1 month before the mission going to Uranus. This means the Iunsel cannot be in March (since it's 1 month before Uranus and March is already occupied by Disty). Therefore, Iunsel must be in February and the mission to Uranus must be in March.
 4. From Clue 1, the Iunsel launched sometime after the probe going to Mercury. This means the probe going to Mercury must be in January.
 5. From Clue 3, the Moro Jaddo launched 1 month after the mission going to Uranus. Since Uranus is in March, Moro Jaddo must be in April.
 6. The only remaining month for a probe is January, and the only remaining probe is Viria Mari. Therefore, Viria Mari launched in January.
 7. The only remaining destination not yet assigned is Ganymede. Since the only month left without a destination is April, Ganymede must be the destination for Moro Jaddo.
 
 Final Answer:
 January | Viria Mari | Mercury
 February | Iunsel | Pluto
 March | Disty | Uranus
 April | Moro Jaddo | Ganymede","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Information**
- From Clue 2: Disty launched in March.

**Step 2: Use Sequential Clues**
- From Clue 5: The Iunsel launched 1 month before the mission going to Uranus.
- From Clue 4: The Iunsel is going to Pluto.
- From Clue 3: The Moro Jaddo launched 1 month after the mission going to Uranus.

**Step 3: Deduce by Elimination**
- Since Iunsel launched 1 month before Uranus and is going to Pluto, and Disty launched in March:
  - Iunsel cannot be in March (Disty is in March).
  - If Iunsel is in February, then the Uranus mission is in March. This fits as Disty is in March but does not go to Uranus.
  - Therefore, Iunsel is in February going to Pluto, and the Uranus mission is in March with Disty.
- From Clue 1: The Iunsel launched sometime after the probe going to Mercury.
  - Since Iunsel is in February, the Mercury mission must be in January.
- Moro Jaddo launched 1 month after Uranus, which places Moro Jaddo in April.

**Step 4: Fill Remaining Slots**
- The only remaining month is January for the probe going to Mercury.
- The only remaining probe is Viria Mari, and the only remaining destination is Ganymede.
- Since Moro Jaddo is in April and the only destination left for April is Ganymede, Moro Jaddo goes to Ganymede.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, Randy Reid left 1 day after the journalist who covered the solar eclipse. This means the solar eclipse coverage cannot be on April 7th, and Randy Reid cannot be on April 4th.
 
 2. From Clue 4, Linda Lott left 1 day before the journalist who covered the flooding. This means Linda Lott cannot be on April 7th, and the flooding cannot be on April 4th.
 
 3. From Clue 1, the four people mentioned (reporter on April 7th, reporter on solar eclipse, reporter on earthquake, Randy Reid) are all different. Since Randy Reid is one of them, he cannot be the reporter on April 7th, nor can he cover the solar eclipse or the earthquake.
 
 4. From Clue 2, Sid Snyder left 1 day after Tam Terry. This means Tam Terry cannot be on April 7th, and Sid Snyder cannot be on April 4th.
 
 5. Since Randy Reid left 1 day after the solar eclipse, and he cannot be on April 4th, the solar eclipse must have been on April 4th, and Randy Reid must have left on April 5th.
 
 6. Since Linda Lott left 1 day before the flooding, and the flooding cannot be on April 4th, Linda Lott must have left on April 5th, and the flooding must have been on April 6th.
 
 7. Since Randy Reid is not covering the solar eclipse, earthquake, or flooding, and he left on April 5th, he must be covering the royal wedding.
 
 8. Since Sid Snyder left 1 day after Tam Terry, and Tam Terry cannot be on April 7th, Tam Terry must have left on April 6th, and Sid Snyder must have left on April 7th.
 
 9. Since the solar eclipse was on April 4th, and Randy Reid, Linda Lott, and Tam Terry are accounted for on other days, the reporter on April 4th must be the remaining reporter, who is Sid Snyder.
 
 10. Since the earthquake is not covered by Randy Reid, and the solar eclipse and flooding are already assigned, the earthquake must be on April 7th.
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 April 4th | Sid Snyder | solar eclipse
 April 5th | Randy Reid | royal wedding
 April 6th | Tam Terry | flooding
 April 7th | Linda Lott | earthquake","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Clue Interpretation**
- Clue 1: The reporter on April 7th, the reporter who covered the solar eclipse, the journalist who covered the earthquake, and Randy Reid are all different individuals.
- Clue 2: Sid Snyder left 1 day after Tam Terry.
- Clue 3: Randy Reid left 1 day after the journalist who covered the solar eclipse.
- Clue 4: Linda Lott left 1 day before the journalist who covered the flooding.

**Step 2: Initial Deductions**
- From Clue 1, Randy Reid cannot be the reporter on April 7th, nor can he cover the solar eclipse or the earthquake.
- From Clue 3, Randy Reid cannot be on April 4th (the earliest day), and the solar eclipse cannot be on April 7th (the latest day).

**Step 3: Sequential Deductions**
- From Clue 2, Sid Snyder must be on the day immediately following Tam Terry.
- From Clue 3, Randy Reid must be on the day immediately following the solar eclipse.
- From Clue 4, Linda Lott must be on the day immediately before the flooding.

**Step 4: Process of Elimination**
- Since Randy Reid cannot be on April 7th, and he follows the solar eclipse, the latest Randy Reid can be is April 6th, which places the solar eclipse on April 5th.
- Since Sid Snyder follows Tam Terry, and Randy Reid is on April 6th, Sid Snyder cannot be on April 6th. Thus, Sid Snyder must be on April 7th, and Tam Terry on April 6th.
- Linda Lott must be on April 4th (the only day left before the flooding on April 5th).

**Step 5: Verification**
- Randy Reid on April 6th, Sid Snyder on April 7th, Tam Terry on April 5th, and Linda Lott on April 4th.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower. This information will help us eliminate Wayne and Seattle Tower from other options.
 
 2. From Clue 4, the person with the $15.50 fare was picked up at the Camlin Hotel. This eliminates the $15.50 fare and Camlin Hotel from other options.
 
 3. From Clue 3, Della was either the client with the $12.50 fare or the person who got picked up at the Seattle Tower. Since Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower, Della must be the client with the $12.50 fare. This eliminates Della and the $12.50 fare from other options.
 
 4. From Clue 2, Elvira paid $6 less than the customer who got picked up at the Moore Mansion. Since the remaining fare options are $6.50 and $9.50, and $6.50 is $6 less than $12.50, Elvira must have paid $6.50, and the person picked up at the Moore Mansion must have paid $12.50. Since Della paid $12.50, Della was picked up at the Moore Mansion. This eliminates Elvira, $6.50 fare, and Moore Mansion from other options.
 
 5. Now, we know:
  - Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower.
  - Della was picked up at the Moore Mansion and paid $12.50.
  - Elvira paid $6.50.
  - The person picked up at the Camlin Hotel paid $15.50.
 
 6. The remaining customer is Isabel, and the remaining pickup point is Neptune Theatre. The remaining fare is $9.50. Therefore, Isabel paid $9.50 and was picked up at Neptune Theatre.
 
 Final Answer:
 $6.50 | Elvira | Moore Mansion
 $9.50 | Isabel | Neptune Theatre
 $12.50 | Della | Seattle Tower
 $15.50 | Wayne | Camlin Hotel","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Information**
- From Clue 1: Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower.
- From Clue 4: The person with the $15.50 fare was picked up at the Camlin Hotel.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning**
- From Clue 3: Della was either the client with the $12.50 fare or the person who got picked up at the Seattle Tower. Since Wayne was picked up at the Seattle Tower, Della must be the client with the $12.50 fare.
- From Clue 2: Elvira paid $6 less than the customer who got picked up at the Moore Mansion. Since the fares are $6.50, $9.50, $12.50, and $15.50, and Elvira paid $6 less, she must have paid $6.50. The only fare $6 more than $6.50 is $12.50, but since Della has the $12.50 fare, the next possible fare for the Moore Mansion pickup is $15.50. However, since the Camlin Hotel already has the $15.50 fare, the Moore Mansion must be associated with the $9.50 fare, and Elvira cannot be associated with the Moore Mansion. Thus, Elvira must be associated with a different location.

**Step 3: Process of Elimination**
- Since Wayne is at Seattle Tower and Della has the $12.50 fare, and Elvira has the $6.50 fare, the remaining fare for Wayne is $9.50. 
- The remaining customer, Isabel, must then have the $15.50 fare and be picked up at the Camlin Hotel.
- The remaining pickup point for Elvira is Neptune Theatre.

**Step 4: Verify Consistency**
- Check all clues and ensure no conflicts:
  - Clue 1 and 3 are satisfied as Wayne is at Seattle Tower and Della has the $12.50 fare.
  - Clue 2 is satisfied as Elvira paid $6.50 and the Moore Mansion has the $9.50 fare.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 5, we know that the cake delivered on October 7 is shaped like a bowling pin. 
 
 2. From Clue 3, since the bowling pin is delivered on October 7, it cannot be delivered on October 5. Therefore, the bowling pin is Mrs. Ingram's cake. 
 
 3. From Clue 4, Mrs. Nolan's cake is shaped like a sports car. 
 
 4. From Clue 1, Mrs. Danielson's cake is delivered 1 day before the sports car. Since Mrs. Nolan's sports car cake cannot be on October 5 (as it's too early for a day before), and it cannot be on October 7 (bowling pin is already scheduled), it must be on October 8. Therefore, Mrs. Danielson's cake is delivered on October 7.
 
 5. From Clue 2, the turtle-shaped cake is delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake. Since Mrs. Ingram's cake is delivered on October 7, the turtle-shaped cake must be delivered on October 5.

**Step 1: Identify Fixed Assignments**
- From Clue 5: The October 7 delivery will be in the shape of a bowling pin.

**Step 2: Use Direct Implications**
- From Clue 4: Mrs. Nolan's cake will be in the shape of a sports car. Since the sports car is not delivered on October 7 (bowling pin), it must be on another date.
- From Clue 1: Mrs. Danielson's cake will be delivered 1 day before the sports car. Since the sports car is not on October 7, it must be on October 8, making Mrs. Danielson's delivery on October 6.

**Step 3: Eliminate Conflicts**
- From Clue 3: The cake shaped like a bowling pin is either the October 5 delivery or Mrs. Ingram's cake. Since October 7 is taken by the bowling pin, Mrs. Ingram's cake cannot be the bowling pin. Therefore, the October 5 delivery must be the bowling pin.
- From Clue 2: The order shaped like a turtle will be delivered 2 days before Mrs. Ingram's cake. Since Mrs. Ingram's cake is not on October 7 or October 8, it must be on October 8 (the only remaining date for Mrs. Ingram after considering other clues). Therefore, the turtle is delivered on October 6.

species : eldar elk, nibner newt, osbele oryx, perens pig.
populations : 210, 280, 315, 385.

Clues:
1. The nibner newt was listed 2 years before the species with a population size of 385.
2. The perens pig is either the animal added to the list in 2006 or the species with a population size of 315.
3. The nibner newt was recognized as endangered in 2006.
4. The species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.
5. The perens pig was listed sometime before the species with a population size of 210.

2006 | correct option from species | correct option from populations
2007 | correct option from species | correct option from populations
2008 | correct option from species | correct option from populations
2009 | correct option from species | correct option from populations
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: From Clue 3, we know the nibner newt was recognized as endangered in 2006. 
 
 Step 2: From Clue 1, since the nibner newt was listed 2 years before the species with a population size of 385, the species with 385 population must have been listed in 2008.
 
 Step 3: From Clue 4, the species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx. Since the nibner newt is already placed in 2006, and the species with 385 population is in 2008, it can't be the perens pig (as per Clue 2, the perens pig is either in 2006 or has a population of 315). Therefore, the osbele oryx must be the species with a population of 385 in 2008.
 
 Step 4: From Clue 2, the perens pig is either in 2006 or has a population of 315. Since 2006 is already taken by the nibner newt, the perens pig must have a population of 315. The only years left for the perens pig are 2007 or 2009.
 
 Step 5: From Clue 5, the perens pig was listed sometime before the species with a population size of 210. This means the perens pig must be in 2007 (since it must be before the species with 210 population, which then must be in 2009).
 
 Step 6: The only species left to assign is the eldar elk, and the only year left is 2009. The only population left is 210. Therefore, the eldar elk must be the species with a population of 210 in 2009.
 
 Final Answer:
 2006 | nibner newt | 280
 2007 | perens pig | 315
 2008 | osbele oryx | 385
 2009 | eldar elk | 210","**Step-by-step solution:**

1. **Using Clue 3**: The nibner newt was recognized as endangered in 2006.
   - 2006 | nibner newt | ?

2. **Using Clue 1**: The nibner newt was listed 2 years before the species with a population size of 385.
   - Since the nibner newt was listed in 2006, the species with a population size of 385 must have been listed in 2008.
   - 2008 | ? | 385

3. **Using Clue 4**: The species with a population size of 385 is either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.
   - Since 2008 has a population of 385, it must be either the perens pig or the osbele oryx.
   - 2008 | perens pig or osbele oryx | 385

4. **Using Clue 2**: The perens pig is either the animal added to the list in 2006 or the species with a population size of 315.
   - Since the nibner newt is already assigned to 2006, the perens pig cannot be in 2006. Therefore, the perens pig must have a population of 315.
   - Since the perens pig cannot be in 2006 and 2008 already has a species with a population of 385, the perens pig must be in 2007.
   - 2007 | perens pig | 315

5. **Using Clue 4 and previous deduction**: Since the perens pig is now assigned to 2007 with a population of 315, the species in 2008 with a population of 385 must be the osbele oryx.
   - 2008 | osbele oryx | 385

6. **Using Clue 5**: The perens pig was listed sometime before the species with a population size of 210.
   - Since the perens pig is in 2007, the species with a population of 210 must be in 2009.
   - 2009 | ? | 210

7. **Remaining species and population**: The only remaining species is the eldar elk and the only remaining population is 280.
   - Since 2009 has a population of 210, the remaining species for 2009 must be the eldar elk.
   - The remaining year, 2006, already has the nibner newt, so the remaining population for 2006 must be 280.
   - 2006 | nibner newt | 280
   - 2009 | eldar elk | 210

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
2006 | nibner newt | 280

115 decibels | correct option from sirens | correct option from years
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, the siren with 105 decibels is either the Bradley X9 or the siren released in 2009.
 2. From Clue 2, the siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009. This means the siren in 1999 must be less than 105 decibels if the 2009 siren could be 105 decibels.
 3. From Clue 3, the Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm.
 4. From Clue 4, the Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide.
 5. From Clue 5, the Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998.
 
 Let's start piecing the information together:
 - If the Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998, and since the decibels are 100, 105, 110, 115, the Rip Tide cannot be 115 decibels. If the Rip Tide were 100 decibels, the 1998 siren would be 110 decibels.
 - From Clue 4, if the Rip Tide is 100 decibels, then the Soundarm would be 105 decibels.
 - From Clue 3, if the Soundarm is 105 decibels, then the Bradley X9 would be 115 decibels.
 - From Clue 1, since the Bradley X9 is 115 decibels, the siren with 105 decibels released in 2009 must be the Soundarm.
 
 Now we know:
 - Rip Tide is 100 decibels.
 - Soundarm is 105 decibels and released in 2009.
 - Bradley X9 is 115 decibels.
 - The siren released in 1998 is 110 decibels, and since all other sirens are assigned, the only one left for 1998 is Securalert.
 - The siren released in 1999 must be quieter than 105 decibels, so it must be the Rip Tide at 100 decibels.
 
 Final Answer:
 100 decibels | Rip Tide | 1999
 105 decibels | Soundarm | 2009
 110 decibels | Securalert | 1998
 115 decibels | Bradley X9 | (year not specified, but since all other years are taken, it must be 2007)","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the siren released in 1998. This establishes a direct relationship between the decibel levels of Rip Tide and the 1998 siren.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 4**
- The Soundarm is 5 decibels louder than the Rip Tide. This helps us establish a sequence of increasing decibels among these sirens.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Bradley X9 is 10 decibels louder than the Soundarm. This clue helps us further extend the sequence of decibel levels.

**Step 4: Establish a decibel sequence**
- From Clues 3, 4, and 5, we can establish a decibel relationship:
  - If Rip Tide is X decibels, then Soundarm is X + 5 decibels, and Bradley X9 is X + 15 decibels.
  - Since Rip Tide is 10 decibels quieter than the 1998 siren, if Rip Tide is X, the 1998 siren is X + 10 decibels.

**Step 5: Determine possible values**
- Given the decibel options (100, 105, 110, 115), and knowing the sequence, we can assign:
  - Rip Tide = 100 decibels
  - Soundarm = 105 decibels
  - 1998 siren = 110 decibels
  - Bradley X9 = 115 decibels

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 1**
- The siren with 105 decibels is either the siren released in 2009 or the Bradley X9. Since Bradley X9 is 115 decibels, the 105 decibels siren released in 2009 must be the Soundarm.

**Step 7: Analyze Clue 2**
- The siren released in 1999 is quieter than the siren released in 2009. Since the 2009 siren (Soundarm) is 105 decibels, the 1999 siren must be Rip Tide with 100 decibels.

**Step 8: Assign remaining years**
- With Rip Tide in 1999 and Soundarm in 2009, Bradley X9 in 1998, the only remaining year for the remaining siren (Securalert) is 2007.

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
```
100 decibels | Rip Tide    | 1999
105 decibels | Soundarm    | 2009

25 feet | correct option from students | correct option from colors
35 feet | correct option from students | correct option from colors
45 feet | correct option from students | correct option from colors
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we know Henrietta's design was silver and went 35 feet.
  - 35 feet | Henrietta | silver
 
 2. From Clue 3, Omar's design went farther than the silver airplane (which went 35 feet). The only distance farther than 35 feet is 45 feet.
  - 45 feet | Omar | (color to be determined)
 
 3. From Clue 5, the pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane. This means the black plane must have gone either 15 feet or 25 feet, as the pink plane must also fit within the available distances.
 
 4. From Clue 4, Ella's design went 10 feet farther than the black plane. This means if the black plane went 15 feet, Ella's would have gone 25 feet, and if the black plane went 25 feet, Ella's would have gone 35 feet. But since 35 feet is already taken by Henrietta, the black plane must have gone 15 feet and Ella's went 25 feet.
  - 15 feet | (student to be determined) | black
  - 25 feet | Ella | (color to be determined)
 
 5. From Clue 5 and the above deduction, the pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane (which went 15 feet), so the pink plane went 25 feet. But since Ella's plane went 25 feet, Ella's plane must be pink.
  - 25 feet | Ella | pink
 
 6. Now, we know:

  - 25 feet | Ella | pink
  - 35 feet | Henrietta | silver
  - 45 feet | Omar | (color to be determined)
 
 7. The only student left for the 15 feet distance is Valerie, as Henrietta, Ella, and Omar are already assigned.

 8. The only color left for Omar's 45 feet plane is blue, as black, pink, and silver are already assigned.
  - 45 feet | Omar | blue
 
 Final Answer:
 15 feet | Valerie | black
 25 feet | Ella | pink
 35 feet | Henrietta | silver
 45 feet | Omar | blue","Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we know Henrietta's airplane went 35 feet and was silver. This directly fills one slot in our table.
   - 35 feet | Henrietta | silver

2. From Clue 3, Omar's airplane went farther than the silver airplane. Since the silver airplane went 35 feet, Omar's airplane must be the next available distance that is farther, which is 45 feet.
   - 45 feet | Omar | (color to be determined)

3. From Clue 5, the pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane. We need to determine the possible distances for the black plane first. Since 35 feet is taken by the silver plane and 45 feet by Omar, the remaining options for the black plane are 15 feet or 25 feet.

4. From Clue 4, Ella's airplane went 10 feet farther than the black plane. If the black plane went 15 feet, Ella's airplane would then be 25 feet. This fits as 25 feet is still available.
   - 25 feet | Ella | (color to be determined)
   - 15 feet | (student to be determined) | black

5. Since the pink plane went 10 feet farther than the black plane, and we have determined the black plane went 15 feet, the pink plane must have gone 25 feet. Ella's airplane is the one that went 25 feet, so Ella's airplane is pink.
   - 25 feet | Ella | pink

6. The only student left for the 15 feet distance is Valerie, and the only color left for Omar's 45 feet airplane is blue.

 1. From clue 1, we know that Casputi was discovered in 2009.
 2. From clue 2, Jack Ingram discovered a comet in 2008.
 3. From clue 3, Underwood discovered a comet in 2010 (2 years after 2008).
 4. From clue 4, Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. Since we don't know Hal's year yet, we'll keep this in mind.
 5. From clue 5, the comet discovered in 2010 is either the one Ken Jones discovered or Crecci. Since Underwood discovered a comet in 2010, it must be either Crecci or Ken Jones discovered Crecci in 2010.
 
 Now, let's fill in what we know:
 - 2008 | Jack Ingram | (unknown comet)
 - 2009 | (unknown astronomer) | Casputi
 - 2010 | Underwood | (either Crecci or Ken Jones discovered Crecci)
 - 2011 | (unknown astronomer) | (unknown comet)
 
 Since Underwood discovered a comet in 2010, and it's either Crecci or Ken Jones discovered Crecci, we can deduce that Underwood discovered Crecci in 2010.
 
 Now, we know:
 - 2008 | Jack Ingram | (unknown comet)
 - 2009 | (unknown astronomer) | Casputi
 - 2010 | Underwood | Crecci
 - 2011 | (unknown astronomer) | (unknown comet)
 
 Since Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet, and the only years left for Hal are 2011, Peinope must have been discovered in 2010. But since 2010 is already taken by Underwood and Crecci, Peinope must have been discovered in 2009, and Hal Gregory discovered his comet in 2010. This contradicts our earlier deduction, so Hal must have discovered his comet in 2011, and Peinope was discovered in 2010. This means Ken Jones discovered Peinope in 2010.
 
 Now, we know:
 - 2008 | Jack Ingram | (unknown comet)
 - 2009 | (unknown astronomer) | Casputi
 - 2010 | Ken Jones | Peinope

 The only comet left for 2008 is Sporrin, and the only astronomer left for 2009 is Underwood.
 
 Final Answer:
 2008 | Jack Ingram | Sporrin
 2009 | Underwood | Casputi
 2010 | Ken Jones | Peinope
 2011 | Hal Gregory | Crecci","Step-by-step solution:
1. From clue 1, we know that the comet discovered in 2009 is Casputi.
2. From clue 2, Jack Ingram discovered a comet in 2008.
3. From clue 3, Underwood discovered a comet in 2010 (2 years after 2008).
4. From clue 4, Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. Since we don't know Hal's year yet, we'll keep this in mind.
5. From clue 5, the comet discovered in 2010 is either the one Ken Jones discovered or Crecci. Since Underwood discovered a comet in 2010, Ken Jones did not discover in 2010. Therefore, the comet in 2010 must be Crecci.

Now, let's fill in the information we have:
- 2008 | Jack Ingram | ?
- 2009 | ? | Casputi
- 2010 | Underwood | Crecci
- 2011 | ? | ?

Continuing from the clues:
- Since Underwood discovered in 2010 and it's Crecci, Ken Jones must discover in a different year. 
- Peinope was discovered 1 year before Hal Gregory discovered a comet. Since Hal cannot be in 2009 (as Casputi was discovered by someone else), and 2010 is taken by Underwood, Hal must be in 2011, and Peinope in 2010. But since 2010 is taken by Crecci, Hal must be in 2011, and Peinope in 2009. This contradicts our earlier assignment, so we need to adjust: Hal is in 2011, and Peinope in 2010, meaning Underwood discovered Peinope, not Crecci.
- Ken Jones then must be in 2009, discovering Casputi.

Finalizing:

350 AD | correct option from cultures | correct option from populations
600 AD | correct option from cultures | correct option from populations
850 AD | correct option from cultures | correct option from populations
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, the Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people are all different. This means Oiracha is not founded in 850 AD and does not have a population of 4,500.
 
 2. From Clue 2, the culture with 9,500 people was founded before the culture with 4,500 people. This means the culture with 9,500 people must be either in 100 AD or 350 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people must be either in 600 AD or 850 AD.
 
 3. From Clue 3, one of the cultures with 4,500 people or 9,500 people is Budel, and the other was founded in 600 AD. Since the culture with 9,500 people was founded before the culture with 4,500 people (from Clue 2), the culture with 9,500 people cannot be in 600 AD. Therefore, the culture with 4,500 people is in 600 AD.
 
 4. From Clue 3 and the above deductions, Budel is either the culture with 4,500 people or 9,500 people. Since the culture with 4,500 people is in 600 AD, Budel must be the culture with 9,500 people or 4,500 people. Since Budel cannot be in 600 AD (as it would contradict the culture with 4,500 people being in 600 AD), Budel must be the culture with 9,500 people.
 
 5. From Clue 4, the culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people. If Budel (9,500 people) is in 100 AD, then the culture with 5,000 people must be in 350 AD.
 
 6. From Clue 5, the Sameos culture was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people. Since the culture with 5,000 people is in 350 AD, the culture with 7,500 people must be in 600 AD. This means the culture with 4,500 people is in 850 AD.
 
 7. From Clue 1, since Oiracha is different from the culture founded in 850 AD and the culture with 4,500 people, Oiracha must be in 350 AD.
 
 8. The remaining culture, Hatgare, must be in 100 AD.
 
 Final Answer:
 100 AD | Hatgare | 9,500
 350 AD | Oiracha | 5,000
 600 AD | Sameos | 7,500
 850 AD | Budel | 4,500","### Step-by-step solution:

**Clue 1:** The Oiracha culture, the culture founded in 850 AD, and the culture with 4,500 people were all different cultures.
- This implies Oiracha is neither founded in 850 AD nor has a population of 4,500.

**Clue 2:** The culture with 9,500 people was founded sometime before the culture with 4,500 people.
- This establishes a chronological order between these two populations.

**Clue 3:** Of the culture with 4,500 people and the culture with 9,500 people, one was the Budel culture and the other was founded in 600 AD.
- This links Budel either to 4,500 or 9,500 people, and either 4,500 or 9,500 people to the year 600 AD.

**Clue 4:** The culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the culture with 9,500 people.
- This helps us calculate the founding years relative to each other for these populations.

**Clue 5:** The Sameos culture was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people.
- This also helps establish a relative timeline between Sameos and the 7,500 population culture.

### Deductions:
- From Clue 4, if the culture with 5,000 people was founded 250 years before the one with 9,500 people, and considering the available years, if 9,500 is linked to 600 AD (from Clue 3), then 5,000 must be linked to 350 AD.
- From Clue 5, if Sameos was founded 250 years before the culture with 7,500 people, and 7,500 cannot be 600 AD (as it's taken by 9,500 from Clue 3 and 4), then Sameos must be 100 AD and 7,500 must be 350 AD.
- From Clue 1, since Oiracha is not 850 AD and not 4,500, and since 850 AD is different from 4,500, we can deduce that 850 AD is linked to another culture and population.
- From Clue 3, if Budel is either 4,500 or 9,500 and one of these is 600 AD, and since 9,500 is linked to 600 AD, Budel must be 4,500 and founded in a different year.

### Final Answer:
- **100 AD | Sameos | 7,500**
- **350 AD | Hatgare | 5,000** (since Oiracha and Sameos are placed, and Budel is 4,500)
- **600 AD | Budel | 9,500**
- **850 AD | Oiracha | 4,500** (since all other options are exhausted)

Using only the clues below, match the years to the options from astronomers and comets. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

years : 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011.
astronomers : Hal Gregory, Jack Ingram, Ken Jones, Tillman.
comets : Casputi, Klionne, Trosny, Wally Six.

Clues:
1. Wally Six is either the comet Tillman discovered or the comet discovered in 2009.
2. Of Trosny and Casputi, one was found in 2008 and the other was first seen by Hal Gregory.
3. The one discovered in 2009 is Casputi.

2009 | correct option from astronomers | correct option from comets
2010 | correct option from astronomers | correct option from comets
2011 | correct option from astronomers | correct option from comets
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, we know that Casputi was discovered in 2009. This gives us one part of the table filled:
  2009 | ? | Casputi
 
 2. From Clue 1, since Casputi was discovered in 2009, Wally Six must be the comet Tillman discovered. This gives us:
  ? | Tillman | Wally Six
 
 3. From Clue 2, since Casputi was discovered in 2009 and not 2008, Trosny must be the comet discovered in 2008. Also, since Casputi was discovered by someone other than Hal Gregory (as it was discovered in 2009), Hal Gregory must have discovered Trosny. This gives us:
  2008 | Hal Gregory | Trosny
 
 4. From Clue 4, since Wally Six is the comet Tillman discovered and not the one discovered in 2008 or 2010, it must be the comet discovered in 2011. Also, since Trosny was discovered in 2008, the comet discovered in 2010 must have been discovered by Jack Ingram. This gives us:
  2010 | Jack Ingram | ?
 
 5. The only remaining year for Wally Six is 2011, and the only remaining comet for Jack Ingram (2010) is Klionne. This gives us:
  2011 | Tillman | Wally Six
  2010 | Jack Ingram | Klionne
 
 6. The only remaining astronomer for 2009 (Casputi) is Ken Jones, as Hal Gregory discovered Trosny in 2008, Jack Ingram discovered Klionne in 2010, and Tillman discovered Wally Six in 2011. This gives us:
  2009 | Ken Jones | Casputi
 
 Final Answer:
 2008 | Hal Gregory | Trosny
 2009 | Ken Jones | Casputi
 2010 | Jack Ingram | Klionne
 2011 | Tillman | Wally Six","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Clue 3**
- 2009 is the year Casputi was discovered.

**Step 2: Clue 1**
- Wally Six is either the comet Tillman discovered or the comet discovered in 2009.
- Since 2009 is already assigned to Casputi, Tillman must have discovered Wally Six.

**Step 3: Clue 4**
- Of the comet discovered in 2010 and the one discovered in 2008, one is Wally Six and the other was first seen by Jack Ingram.
- Since Tillman discovered Wally Six, Wally Six cannot be the comet discovered in 2010 (as it would conflict with the astronomer).
- Therefore, Wally Six was discovered in 2008, and the comet discovered in 2010 was first seen by Jack Ingram.

**Step 4: Clue 2**
- Of Trosny and Casputi, one was found in 2008 and the other was first seen by Hal Gregory.
- Since 2008 is already assigned to Wally Six, Hal Gregory must have discovered Casputi in 2009.

**Step 5: Remaining Assignments**
- The remaining comet for 2010, seen by Jack Ingram, must be Klionne (as Trosny and Casputi are already assigned, and Wally Six was discovered in 2008).
- The remaining year, 2011, must then be assigned to the remaining astronomer, Ken Jones, and the remaining comet, which is Trosny.

 1. From clue 5, we know that Lyle Lucas started in 2007. We need to determine his superhero identity.
 2. From clue 3, ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino. We need to find out which year he started.
 3. From clue 4, either ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) or Peter Powers started in 2009 and the other in 2010. 
 4. From clue 2, the hero who started in 2009 is either ""Criminal Bane"" or Peter Powers. Since ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino, Peter Powers cannot be ""Ultra Hex"". Therefore, Peter Powers must have started in 2010, and ""Criminal Bane"" or ""Ultra Hex"" started in 2009.
 5. Since ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino and he started either in 2009 or 2010, and Peter Powers started in 2010, ""Ultra Hex"" must have started in 2009.
 6. From clue 1, ""Green Avenger"" began 1 year before Peter Powers. Since Peter Powers started in 2010, ""Green Avenger"" started in 2009. But since ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) started in 2009, ""Green Avenger"" must have started in 2008.
 7. The only remaining year for ""Criminal Bane"" is 2010, and the only remaining superhero for Lyle Lucas (who started in 2007) is Max Fusion.
 
 Final Answer:
 2007 | Max Fusion | Lyle Lucas
 2008 | Green Avenger | Hal Houston
 2009 | Ultra Hex | Tim Trevino
 2010 | Criminal Bane | Peter Powers","Step-by-step solution:
- From clue 5, we know that Lyle Lucas started in 2007. So, we can fill in:
  2007 | ? | Lyle Lucas

- From clue 3, we know that ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino. We will use this information as we proceed.

- From clue 4, either ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) or Peter Powers started in 2009 and the other in 2010. Since ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino, we can fill in:
  2009 | ? | ?
  2010 | ? | ?

- From clue 2, the hero who started in 2009 is either ""Criminal Bane"" or Peter Powers. Since we know from clue 4 that either ""Ultra Hex"" or Peter Powers started in 2009, and ""Ultra Hex"" is Tim Trevino, it must be Peter Powers who started in 2009. Thus:
  2009 | ? | Peter Powers

- Since Peter Powers started in 2009, ""Ultra Hex"" (Tim Trevino) must have started in 2010:
  2010 | Ultra Hex | Tim Trevino

- From clue 1, ""Green Avenger"" began 1 year before Peter Powers. Since Peter Powers began in 2009, ""Green Avenger"" began in 2008:
  2008 | Green Avenger | ?

- Now, we know the remaining superhero in 2009 must be ""Criminal Bane"" since Peter Powers is the real name already assigned to 2009:
  2009 | Criminal Bane | Peter Powers

- The remaining year, 2007, must be assigned to the remaining superhero, which is ""Max Fusion"":
  2007 | Max Fusion | Lyle Lucas

- The remaining real name for 2008, where ""Green Avenger"" is the superhero, must be Hal Houston, as Tim Trevino and Peter Powers are already assigned, and Lyle Lucas started in 2007:

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, we know Grosmolen was built in 1729.
 2. From Clue 3, we know Vlietmolen was built in 1706.
 3. From Clue 1, since Grosmolen was built in 1729, it must be owned by the De Vries family (since the other option for 1729 is Doesmolen, which must then be the one built in 1683).
 4. Now, we know:
  - 1683 | Doesmolen | (unknown family)
  - 1706 | Vlietmolen | (unknown family)
  - 1729 | Grosmolen | De Vries
  - 1752 | (unknown windmill) | (unknown family)
 5. From Clue 4, the Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill. This means the only possible years for Meijer and Bakker are 1706 and 1729, or 1729 and 1752. Since Grosmolen in 1729 is owned by De Vries, Meijer must be in 1706 and Bakker in 1729.
 6. Now, we know:

1. From Clue 2, we know Grosmolen was built in 1729.
2. From Clue 3, we know Vlietmolen was built in 1706.
3. From Clue 1, since Grosmolen was built in 1729 and is one of the windmills mentioned in the clue, the other windmill built in 1683 must be Doesmolen. Also, one of these (Doesmolen or Grosmolen) is owned by the De Vries family.
4. Since Grosmolen is already assigned to 1729, Doesmolen must be assigned to 1683.
5. From Clue 4, the Bakker family's structure was built 23 years after the Meijer family's windmill. Since we know Grosmolen (1729) is not associated with the Bakker family (as it would imply a year beyond the given options for the Meijer family's windmill), and Vlietmolen is in 1706, the Meijer family must be associated with Vlietmolen. This places the Bakker family's windmill in 1729 + 23 = 1752.
6. The remaining windmill for 1752 is Zemelmolen, which must be associated with the Bakker family.
7. Since the De Vries family is associated with either Doesmolen or Grosmolen, and Grosmolen is already in 1729, De Vries must be associated with Grosmolen.
8. The remaining family for 1683 and Doesmolen is Meijer, as Bakker is in 1752 and De Vries is in 1729.

 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 first | Nick | (unknown item)
 second | Wesley | bowling pins
 third | Lora | flashlights
 fourth | Carmen | balls
 
 To determine the item Nick used, we know it can't be flashlights, balls, or bowling pins (used by others). The only item left is batons, which contradicts Clue 3. Therefore, Nick must have used the remaining item not listed in the clues, which is an error in our initial assumption. Revisiting the clues, we realize that Nick must have used the only item left unassigned correctly, which is not batons but rather the only item left, which is balls. This means Carmen must have used another item, which is batons, as it's the only one left.
 
 Corrected Final Answer:
 first | Nick | balls
 second | Wesley | bowling pins
 third | Lora | flashlights
 fourth | Carmen | batons","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Direct Clues**
- Clue 2 states that Nick went first. We can place Nick in the first order.

**Step 2: Logical Deduction**
- Clue 1 states that the person who went third was either Nick or the juggler who used flashlights. Since Nick went first, the person who went third must have used flashlights.
- Clue 3 states that the performer who used batons performed 1 spot after the person who used flashlights. Since flashlights were used third, batons must be used fourth.
- Clue 4 states that of Nick and Carmen, one went second and the other used balls. Since Nick went first, Carmen cannot be second, so Carmen must have used balls. Since Nick cannot be second, the second performer must be the other option, which we will determine.
- Clue 5 states that the performer who used flashlights was either Lora or Carmen. Since Carmen used balls, Lora must have used flashlights and performed third.

**Step 3: Process of Elimination**
- Since Nick went first and used balls (from Clue 4), Carmen cannot be second. We know Lora is third with flashlights, and the fourth performer used batons. The remaining name for the second performer is Wesley.
- The remaining item for Wesley (second performer) must be bowling pins, as all other items are accounted for.

**Step 4: Verification**
- Check all clues are satisfied:
  - Clue 1: Third performer used flashlights (Lora, correct).
  - Clue 2: Nick went first (correct).
  - Clue 3: Batons follow flashlights (fourth after third, correct).
  - Clue 4: Carmen used balls, and Nick did not go second (correct).
  - Clue 5: Lora used flashlights (correct).

### Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

| Order  | Name   | Item         |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| first  | Nick   | balls        |
| second | Wesley | bowling pins |
| third  | Lora   | flashlights  |
| fourth | Carmen | batons       |

342.json,"Megan is setting up an exhibit at the National Museum of Fiji about the discovery of several small South Sea islands. Using only the clues below, match the years to the options from islands and cultures. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

years : 1754, 1761, 1768, 1775.
islands : Fushil, Jujihm, Teuz, Zafet.
cultures : Hakili, Holo'oka, Manika'i, Kukani.

Clues:
1. The island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Jujihm or Teuz.
2. Of the island on which the Holo'oka people lived and the island discovered in 1761, one was Fushil and the other was Teuz.
3. The island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived.
4. Fushil was discovered sometime before Teuz.
5. The island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1754 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1761 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1768 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1775 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, we know that the island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Fushil or Teuz, and one of these islands was discovered in 1761. From Clue 4, Fushil was discovered before Teuz. Therefore, Fushil was discovered in 1761 and Teuz was discovered later.
 
 2. From Clue 1, the Holo'oka people lived on either Jujihm or Teuz. Since Teuz was discovered later than 1761 and Fushil was discovered in 1761, the Holo'oka people must have lived on Teuz.
 
 3. From Clue 5, the island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm. This means Jujihm was discovered after the island of the Hakili people.
 
 4. From Clue 3, the island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered after the island on which the Manika'i people lived. Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and Teuz was discovered later, and since the Hakili people lived on an island discovered before Jujihm, the only option left for the Hakili people is 1761, and Jujihm must be 1768.
 
 5. Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and the Hakili people lived on the island discovered 7 years before Jujihm (1768 - 7 = 1761), the Hakili people lived on Fushil.
 
 6. The Manika'i people must have lived on an island discovered before 1761 (since the Hakili people lived on an island discovered after the Manika'i people). The only year before 1761 is 1754. The only island left for 1754 is Zafet.
 
 7. The only remaining island for 1775 is Jujihm, and the only remaining culture is Kukani.
 
 Final Answer:
 1754 | Zafet | Manika'i
 1761 | Fushil | Hakili
 1768 | Jujihm | Holo'oka
 1775 | Teuz | Kukani","Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 4 (Fushil was discovered sometime before Teuz), we establish the order of discovery between Fushil and Teuz.
2. From Clue 2 (Of the island on which the Holo'oka people lived and the island discovered in 1761, one was Fushil and the other was Teuz), we know that either Fushil or Teuz was discovered in 1761, and one of them is where Holo'oka lived.
3. From Clue 1 (The island on which the Holo'oka people lived was either Jujihm or Teuz), we can deduce that Holo'oka lived on Teuz since Fushil was discovered before Teuz (from Clue 4) and one of Fushil or Teuz was discovered in 1761.
4. Since Teuz is where Holo'oka lived, and it was either discovered in 1761 or later, and Fushil was discovered before Teuz, Fushil must be the island discovered in 1761.
5. From Clue 5 (The island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered 7 years before Jujihm), we can calculate the years once we place Jujihm.
6. From Clue 3 (The island on which the Hakili people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived), we know the relative order of discovery between Hakili and Manika'i.

Let's apply these clues:
- Since Fushil was discovered in 1761 and before Teuz, and Holo'oka lived on Teuz, Teuz cannot be 1761. Therefore, Teuz must be discovered after 1761.
- If we place Jujihm in 1775, then Hakili, which was discovered 7 years before Jujihm, would be in 1768.
- Since Hakili was discovered after Manika'i (Clue 3), Manika'i must be in 1754.
- The remaining island, Zafet, and the remaining culture, Kukani, must then be placed in the remaining year, 1775.

Final Answer:
1754 | Manika'i | Fushil
1761 | Fushil | Holo'oka
1768 | Hakili | Teuz

$8.75 | correct option from customers | correct option from superfoods
$9.75 | correct option from customers | correct option from superfoods
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 1, Gene paid $7.75.
 2. From clue 4, Rosa asked for chia seeds.
 3. From clue 2, Rosa paid $1 more than the person who requested ginger. Since Rosa paid more than the person with ginger, and the only prices higher than $7.75 are $8.75 and $9.75, Rosa must have paid either of these. Since Rosa paid $1 more than the person with ginger, the person with ginger must have paid either $7.75 or $8.75. Since Gene paid $7.75 and didn't get ginger (as per the prices), the person with ginger must have paid $8.75, and thus Rosa paid $9.75.
 4. From clue 3, the person who requested acai berries and the customer who requested ginger, one paid $8.75 and the other is Delores. Since the person with ginger paid $8.75, Delores did not request ginger. Therefore, Delores must have requested acai berries and paid a different amount. The only remaining prices are $6.75 and $8.75. Since ginger is $8.75, Delores must have paid $6.75.
 5. The remaining customer is Betsy, and the remaining superfood is kale. The only remaining price is $8.75, which is already taken by ginger. Therefore, Betsy must have paid the remaining price, which is $7.75, but since Gene already paid $7.75, Betsy must pay the remaining price which is $8.75.
 
 Final Answer:
 $6.75 | Delores | acai berries
 $7.75 | Gene | kale
 $8.75 | Betsy | ginger
 $9.75 | Rosa | chia seeds","Step-by-step solution:

1. From clue 1, we know Gene paid $7.75.
   - $7.75 | Gene | ?

2. From clue 4, Rosa asked for chia seeds.
   - ? | Rosa | chia seeds

3. From clue 2, Rosa paid $1 more than the person who requested ginger. Since we don't know the price for ginger yet, we can't directly assign Rosa's price, but we know it's $1 more than the price of ginger.

4. From clue 3, we know that the person who requested acai berries and the customer who requested ginger have prices $8.75 and one of them is Delores. Since we know the prices are $6.75, $7.75, $8.75, and $9.75, and Gene already took $7.75, the remaining prices are $6.75, $8.75, and $9.75. Since Rosa pays $1 more than the person with ginger, and one of the prices between acai berries and ginger is $8.75, the other must be $9.75. Since Rosa pays $1 more than the ginger, ginger must be $8.75 and Rosa must be $9.75.
   - $8.75 | ? | ginger
   - $9.75 | Rosa | chia seeds

5. Since one of acai berries or ginger is Delores and ginger is $8.75, Delores must be the one who requested ginger.
   - $8.75 | Delores | ginger

6. Since acai berries is the other option in clue 3 and must be $9.75, and Rosa already took $9.75, acai berries must be $6.75.
   - $6.75 | ? | acai berries

7. The remaining customer for $6.75 is Betsy, as Gene and Rosa are already assigned, and Delores is with ginger.
   - $6.75 | Betsy | acai berries

8. The only remaining superfood is kale and the only remaining customer is Gene, but Gene's price is already $7.75.

1. **Clue 3**: The interview on August 21st is for the web developer job.
   - August 21st | ? | web developer

2. **Clue 2**: The interview on August 23rd is for the tech support job.
   - August 23rd | ? | tech support

3. **Clue 1**: The Streeter Inc. interview is 2 days after the Canway interview.
   - This clue will be used to determine the placement of Canway and Streeter Inc. once more information is available.

4. **Clue 4**: Of the interview on August 23rd and the interview on August 20th, one is at Laneplex and the other is for the sales rep job.
   - Since August 23rd is for tech support, it cannot be for the sales rep job. Therefore, August 20th is for the sales rep job.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's computer. This means Victor's computer must have a hard drive of either 384 GB or 512 GB.
 
 2. From Clue 4, the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM. This means if the 1 GB RAM computer has a 128 GB hard drive, then the 4 GB RAM computer must have a 384 GB hard drive.
 
 3. From Clue 5, the computer with 256 GB of hard drive space is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM. Since we know from Clue 2 that the computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive smaller than Alejandro's, and Alejandro's must be larger than 256 GB, it means Otis must have the 256 GB hard drive.
 
 4. From Clue 1, Jack's computer is either the system with 256 GB of hard drive space or the build with 4 GB of RAM. Since Otis has the 256 GB hard drive, Jack must have the 4 GB of RAM and thus the 384 GB hard drive.
 
 5. From Clue 2, the computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive smaller than Alejandro's. Since Alejandro's is larger than 256 GB and Jack has the 384 GB, Alejandro must have the 512 GB hard drive. This leaves the 12 GB RAM computer with the 128 GB hard drive.
 
 6. From Clue 3, Victor's computer must be 256 GB larger than the 1 GB RAM computer. Since the 1 GB RAM computer has a 128 GB hard drive, Victor's must be 384 GB. But since Jack already has the 384 GB hard drive, Victor must have the 512 GB hard drive, and Alejandro must have the 128 GB hard drive.

 Final Answer:
 128 GB | Alejandro | 12 GB
 256 GB | Otis | 3 GB
 384 GB | Jack | 4 GB
 512 GB | Victor | 1 GB","Step-by-step solution:
- Analyzing Clue 3, the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB smaller than Victor's computer. This establishes a relationship between the size of Victor's hard drive and the computer with 1 GB of RAM.
- From Clue 4, the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive that is 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM. This helps us link the hard drive sizes of these two RAM capacities.
- Clue 5 states that the computer with 256 GB of hard drive space is either Otis's system or the system with 12 GB of RAM. This clue helps narrow down the possibilities for the 256 GB hard drive.

Let's start filling in the grid:
- If the computer with 1 GB of RAM has a hard drive 256 GB smaller than Victor's, and the computer with 4 GB of RAM has a hard drive 256 GB larger than the computer with 1 GB of RAM, then:
  - If the 1 GB RAM computer has 128 GB, then the 4 GB RAM computer must have 384 GB. This leaves Victor with either 256 GB or 512 GB.

- From Clue 2, the computer with 12 GB of RAM has a hard drive smaller than Alejandro's. This means Alejandro cannot have the smallest hard drive.
- From Clue 1, Jack's computer is either the system with 256 GB of hard drive space or the build with 4 GB of RAM. Since we know the 4 GB RAM computer has 384 GB, Jack cannot have 256 GB if he has 4 GB of RAM.

Assigning based on deductions:
- If Jack has 4 GB of RAM and 384 GB hard drive, then from Clue 1, this is confirmed.
- If the 1 GB RAM computer has 128 GB, then Victor must have 384 GB or 512 GB. Since 384 GB is taken by Jack, Victor must have 512 GB.
- This leaves Otis with the 256 GB hard drive, and from Clue 5, Otis cannot have 12 GB of RAM, so he must have 3 GB of RAM.
- Alejandro then has the remaining 12 GB of RAM and the only remaining hard drive size, which is 256 GB.

Final Answer:
128 GB | Otis | 1 GB
256 GB | Alejandro | 12 GB
384 GB | Jack | 4 GB

June 14th | correct option from names | correct option from careers
July 16th | correct option from names | correct option from careers
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, we know Harry is the musician.
 2. From Clue 2, Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's. Since Harry is a musician, his career is not dependent on the surgeon or architect's timeline.
 3. From Clue 3, Adrian's birthday is 1 month after the surgeon's.
 4. From Clue 4, the architect's birthday is 2 months after the surgeon's.
 
 Let's assign the birthdays:
 - Since Harry is the musician and Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's, we need to find a pair of months that are one month apart. The possible pairs are April-May, May-June, and June-July.
 
 Let's try Harry in June (June 14th) as the musician:
 - Dale would then be in July (July 16th).
 
 Now, we need to place the surgeon, Adrian, and the architect:
 - Adrian is 1 month after the surgeon (Clue 3).
 - The architect is 2 months after the surgeon (Clue 4).
 
 If we place the surgeon in April (April 13th):
 - Adrian would be in May (May 18th) (1 month after April).
 - The architect would be in June (June 14th) (2 months after April).
 
 However, Harry is already placed in June as the musician. This conflict means the surgeon cannot be in April. Let's try another arrangement.
 
 If we place the surgeon in May (May 18th):
 - Adrian would be in June (June 14th) (1 month after May).
 - The architect would be in July (July 16th) (2 months after May).
 
 This arrangement fits without conflicts:
 - Harry is the musician in June.
 - Dale is in July, 1 month after Harry.
 - Adrian is in June, 1 month after the surgeon in May.
 - The architect is in July, 2 months after the surgeon in May.
 
 Since all careers are assigned except for the lawyer, Lamar must be the lawyer, and his birthday must be the remaining unassigned date, which is April 13th.
 
 Final Answer:
 April 13th | Lamar | lawyer
 May 18th | surgeon | surgeon
 June 14th | Adrian | musician
 July 16th | Dale | architect","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Identify Direct Clues**
- From clue 1: Harry is the musician.

**Step 2: Sequential Clues**
- From clue 2: Dale has a birthday 1 month after Harry.
- From clue 3: Adrian has a birthday 1 month after the surgeon.
- From clue 4: The architect has a birthday 2 months after the surgeon.

**Step 3: Assigning Dates**
- Since Harry is the musician, and Dale's birthday is 1 month after Harry's, we need to find a date that allows another date exactly one month later. The possible dates for Harry are April 13th or May 18th, as June 14th would not allow a month later within the given dates.
- If Harry is on April 13th, Dale would be on May 18th. If Harry is on May 18th, Dale would be on June 14th.

**Step 4: Further Deductions**
- If Harry is on April 13th and Dale on May 18th, then:
  - The surgeon cannot be on April 13th or May 18th because Adrian (not the surgeon) needs a date 1 month after the surgeon, and the architect is 2 months after the surgeon.
  - If the surgeon is on June 14th, Adrian would be on July 16th, and the architect would not fit any remaining date.
  - Therefore, Harry cannot be on April 13th.

- If Harry is on May 18th and Dale on June 14th:
  - The surgeon could be on April 13th, Adrian would then be on May 18th, but Adrian cannot be on the same day as Harry.
  - Therefore, the surgeon must be on another date.

- If the surgeon is on July 16th:
  - Adrian would be on a non-existent August date, which is impossible.

- Therefore, the surgeon must be on June 14th:
  - Adrian is then on July 16th.
  - The architect, being 2 months after the surgeon, would be on a non-existent August date, which is impossible.

- Re-evaluating, if the surgeon is on May 18th:
  - Adrian would be on June 14th.
  - The architect would be on July 16th.
  - This setup fits all clues and dates.

**Step 5: Final Assignment**
- Harry is the musician on May 18th.
- Dale is on June 14th, and the remaining career for him is lawyer.
- Adrian is on July 16th, and he is not the musician or lawyer, so he is the architect.
- The remaining person, Lamar, is on April 13th, and the remaining career is surgeon.

342.json,"The Unionville Animal Preserve occasionally takes in and cares for ""nuisance"" alligators that are captured on private property.  Each is given a unique name. Using only the clues below, match the ages to the options from names and lengths. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

ages : 5, 10, 15, 20.
names : Arthur, Carlos, Iggy, Sparky.
lengths : 11.5 feet, 12.0 feet, 13.6 feet, 14.0 feet.

Clues:
1. The alligator that is 14.0 feet long is either the 20 year old alligator or Arthur.
2. The animal that is 11.5 feet long is somewhat younger than Arthur.
3. Of the animal that is 12.0 feet long and Carlos, one is 20 years old and the other is 10 years old.
4. The alligator that is 11.5 feet long is 5 years younger than Carlos.
5. Iggy is 10 years younger than the animal that is 14.0 feet long.

10 | correct option from names | correct option from lengths
15 | correct option from names | correct option from lengths
20 | correct option from names | correct option from lengths
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, the alligator that is 14.0 feet long is either the 20-year-old alligator or Arthur. We can't decide yet, so we'll keep this in mind.
 
 2. From Clue 2, the alligator that is 11.5 feet long is younger than Arthur. This means Arthur cannot be the youngest and is not 11.5 feet long.
 
 3. From Clue 3, the alligator that is 12.0 feet long and Carlos are either 20 years old or 10 years old. We need more information to decide.
 
 4. From Clue 4, the alligator that is 11.5 feet long is 5 years younger than Carlos. Since the only ages 5 years apart are 5 and 10, or 10 and 15, and since the 11.5 feet long alligator is younger, Carlos must be 10 years old and the 11.5 feet long alligator is 5 years old.
 
 5. From Clue 5, Iggy is 10 years younger than the alligator that is 14.0 feet long. Since the 14.0 feet long alligator could be 20 years old (from Clue 1), Iggy must be 10 years old. This confirms Carlos is not 10 years old, so Carlos must be 20 years old and 12.0 feet long (from Clue 3).
 
 6. Since Carlos is 20 years old and 12.0 feet long, and Iggy is 10 years old, the 14.0 feet long alligator must be Arthur and 20 years old (from Clue 1). This leaves Sparky as the remaining name and age, which must be 15 years old.
 
 7. The lengths left are 13.6 feet for Sparky, as the other lengths have been assigned.
 
 Final Answer:
 5 | Iggy | 11.5 feet
 10 | Carlos | 12.0 feet
 15 | Sparky | 13.6 feet
 20 | Arthur | 14.0 feet","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Clue 1:** The alligator that is 14.0 feet long is either the 20-year-old alligator or Arthur.
- This clue restricts the 14.0 feet long alligator to either being 20 years old or named Arthur.

**Clue 2:** The animal that is 11.5 feet long is somewhat younger than Arthur.
- Arthur cannot be the youngest (5 years old), so Arthur must be at least 10 years old.

**Clue 3:** Of the animal that is 12.0 feet long and Carlos, one is 20 years old and the other is 10 years old.
- This sets specific age possibilities for Carlos and the 12.0 feet long alligator.

**Clue 4:** The alligator that is 11.5 feet long is 5 years younger than Carlos.
- This helps us determine Carlos's age relative to the 11.5 feet long alligator.

**Clue 5:** Iggy is 10 years younger than the animal that is 14.0 feet long.
- This helps determine Iggy's age relative to the 14.0 feet long alligator.

**Using the clues:**
- From Clue 1 and Clue 5, if the 14.0 feet long alligator is 20 years old, then Iggy must be 10 years old.
- From Clue 3, if Iggy is 10 years old, he cannot be Carlos. Therefore, Carlos must be 20 years old and the 12.0 feet long alligator is 10 years old.
- From Clue 4, if Carlos is 20 years old, the 11.5 feet long alligator must be 15 years old (5 years younger than Carlos).
- From Clue 2, since the 11.5 feet long alligator is 15 years old and younger than Arthur, Arthur cannot be 15 years old or younger. Arthur must be the 14.0 feet long alligator and 20 years old.
- This leaves Sparky as the remaining name for the 12.0 feet long, 10-year-old alligator.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
5 | Iggy | 13.6 feet
10 | Sparky | 12.0 feet

Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

year sent : 1962, 1969, 1976, 1983.
writers : George, Karla, Sean, Tracy.
origins : Brighton, Le Havre, Penzance, Torquay.

Clues:
1. The letter that was sent in 1962 was from Torquay.
2. George's message was sent in 1969.
3. Of the letter from Brighton and the missive that was sent in 1976, one is George's and the other is Karla's.

1969 | correct option from writers | correct option from origins
1976 | correct option from writers | correct option from origins
1983 | correct option from writers | correct option from origins
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From clue 1, the letter sent in 1962 is from Torquay.
  - 1962 | ? | Torquay
 
 2. From clue 2, George's message was sent in 1969.
  - 1969 | George | ?
 
 3. From clue 3, we know that one of the letters from Brighton or the one sent in 1976 is George's and the other is Karla's. Since George's letter was sent in 1969, Karla's letter must be the one from 1976 or Brighton. Since George's letter is already assigned to 1969, it cannot be from Brighton or 1976. Therefore, Karla's letter must be from Brighton and sent in 1976.
  - 1976 | Karla | Brighton
 
 4. From clue 4, Tracy's message, the bottle sent in 1983, and the message from Penzance are all different. Since 1962 is Torquay, 1976 is Brighton, the only years left for Penzance are 1969 and 1983. Since 1969 is already taken by George, Penzance must be 1983, and Tracy cannot be 1983. Therefore, Tracy's message must be from a different year.
  - 1983 | ? | Penzance
 
 5. Now, we know:
  - 1962 | ? | Torquay
  - 1969 | George | ?
  - 1976 | Karla | Brighton
  - 1983 | ? | Penzance
 
 6. Since Tracy's message is not from 1983 and Penzance, and Karla's is already assigned, the only years left for Tracy are 1962 or 1969. Since 1969 is taken by George, Tracy must be 1962.
  - 1962 | Tracy | Torquay
 
 7. The only writer left for 1983 is Sean.
  - 1983 | Sean | Penzance
 
 8. The only origin left for 1969 (George's message) is Le Havre.
  - 1969 | George | Le Havre
 
 Final Answer:
 1962 | Tracy | Torquay
 1969 | George | Le Havre
 1976 | Karla | Brighton
 1983 | Sean | Penzance","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Assign known facts from clues**
- From Clue 1: The letter sent in 1962 was from Torquay.
- From Clue 2: George's message was sent in 1969.

**Step 2: Analyze and apply additional clues**
- From Clue 3: Between the letter from Brighton and the one sent in 1976, one is George's and the other is Karla's. Since George's message was sent in 1969, Karla's message must be the one sent in 1976. Consequently, the letter from Brighton must be George's, which was sent in 1969.

**Step 3: Use process of elimination for remaining options**
- From Clue 4: Tracy's message, the bottle sent in 1983, and the message from Penzance are all different letters. Since 1969 is George's from Brighton and 1976 is Karla's, Tracy cannot be associated with 1969 or 1976. Also, 1983 cannot be from Penzance.
- Since 1962 is from Torquay and 1969 is from Brighton, the remaining origins for 1976 and 1983 are Penzance and Le Havre. Since 1983 cannot be Penzance (Clue 4), it must be Le Havre. Therefore, 1976 is from Penzance.
- The remaining writer for 1983 is Tracy (as deduced from Clue 4 and previous eliminations).
- The only remaining year and writer for 1962 is Sean (since George is 1969, Karla is 1976, and Tracy is 1983).

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1962 | Sean | Torquay

 1. From clue 1, we know that the 9:00am tour starts at Greektown.
 2. From clue 4, we know that Dustin's trip starts at Casa Loma. The time for this is not yet known.
 3. From clue 3, we know that one of the tours at Greektown or High Park starts at 7:00am and one is guided by Janice. Since Greektown is at 9:00am, High Park must be the location at 7:00am. Janice must be the guide for one of these tours. Since 9:00am is already assigned to Greektown, Janice must be the guide for the 9:00am Greektown tour.
 4. From clue 2, Faye's tour starts 1 hour before Kelly's. This means they must be at consecutive times.
 5. Since Janice is at 9:00am and Dustin's location is known but not his time, Dustin cannot be at 8:00am or 10:00am because that would not allow consecutive slots for Faye and Kelly. Therefore, Dustin must be at 7:00am at Casa Loma.
 6. This leaves 8:00am and 10:00am for Faye and Kelly. Since Faye's tour is 1 hour before Kelly's, Faye must be at 8:00am and Kelly at 10:00am.
 7. The only location left for 8:00am (Faye's tour) is Little Italy, and the only location left for 10:00am (Kelly's tour) is High Park.

 10:00am | Kelly | High Park","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Information**
- From Clue 1: The 9:00am tour starts at Greektown.
- From Clue 4: Dustin's trip starts at Casa Loma.

**Step 2: Use Process of Elimination**
- From Clue 3: The tour at Greektown is either with Janice or at 7:00am. Since it's at 9:00am, Janice must be the guide for Greektown.
- From Clue 3: The tour at High Park must then be at 7:00am.

**Step 3: Logical Deduction**
- From Clue 2: Faye's outing is 1 hour before Kelly's. The only slots left are 8:00am and 10:00am. Thus, Faye is at 8:00am and Kelly is at 10:00am.
- Since Dustin is at Casa Loma and Janice is at Greektown, the remaining guide for 7:00am at High Park is either Faye or Kelly. Since Faye is at 8:00am, Kelly must be at 10:00am, and the remaining guide for 7:00am is the one not yet assigned, which is not Faye or Kelly, leaving Dustin. However, Dustin is already assigned to Casa Loma, so the guide at 7:00am must be the remaining one, which is not Faye or Kelly, leaving the only option as Dustin.

**Step 4: Fill Remaining Locations**
- Locations left are Little Italy and High Park. Since High Park is at 7:00am, Little Italy must be at 10:00am.

Clues:
1. Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
2. The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
3. The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
January | correct option from names | correct option from birds
February | correct option from names | correct option from birds
March | correct option from names | correct option from birds
April | correct option from names | correct option from birds
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, we know that one of the birds bought in February and January is the macaw and the other is owned by Gladys. 
 
 2. From Clue 2, the macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet. This means Ellen's pet cannot be in January or February, and the macaw must be in January or February to allow a 2-month gap.
 
 3. From Clue 3, the parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch. This means the finch cannot be in April, and the parakeet cannot be in January.
 
 4. From Clue 4, Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet. This means Alberta's pet cannot be in April, and Gladys's pet cannot be in January.
 
 5. From Clue 5, the finch was bought sometime after the lovebird. This means the lovebird cannot be in April, and the finch cannot be in January.
 
 Using these clues:
 - If the macaw was bought in January (from Clue 2), Ellen's pet would be in March. This fits as the macaw is 2 months before March.
 - If the macaw is in January, then Gladys's pet must be in February (from Clue 1).
 - Since Alberta's pet is 1 month before Gladys's, Alberta's pet must be in January (from Clue 4).
 - This means Ellen's pet is in March, and the only remaining month for Della is April.
 
 Now, assigning birds:
 - Since the macaw is in January, and the finch is after the lovebird (from Clue 5), and the parakeet is 1 month after the finch (from Clue 3), the only arrangement that fits is:
  - Lovebird in February, Finch in March, Parakeet in April.
 
 Final Answer:
 January | Alberta | Macaw
 February | Gladys | Lovebird
 March | Ellen | Finch
 April | Della | Parakeet","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- Alberta's pet was bought 1 month before Gladys's pet.
  - This establishes a direct sequence between Alberta and Gladys.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Of the bird bought in February and the bird bought in January, one is Gladys's and the other is the macaw.
  - Since Gladys is directly linked to Alberta by Clue 4, and one of them must be in January or February, we can start positioning them.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- The macaw was bought 2 months before Ellen's pet.
  - This helps us place Ellen relative to the macaw.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 5**
- The finch was bought sometime after the lovebird.
  - This clue helps us order the purchase of these two birds.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 3**
- The parakeet was bought 1 month after the finch.
  - This further helps in sequencing the birds.

**Step 6: Deduction and Placement**
- From Clue 4 and Clue 1, if Alberta's pet is bought 1 month before Gladys's, and Gladys's pet is one of the birds in January or February, Alberta must be in January and Gladys in February.
- Since the macaw is one of the birds in January or February (Clue 1), and it cannot be Alberta's (as Alberta's is 1 month before Gladys's), the macaw must be Gladys's pet in February.
- From Clue 2, since the macaw is in February, Ellen's pet must be in April (2 months later).
- From Clue 5 and Clue 3, the lovebird must be before the finch, and the finch must be before the parakeet. Since Ellen's pet is in April and it's 2 months after the macaw, Ellen's pet cannot be the finch or lovebird. Thus, Ellen's pet is the parakeet.
- The only month left for the finch is March, and the only bird left for January is the lovebird.
- The only names left for March and January are Della and Alberta, respectively. Since Alberta is in January (from earlier deduction), Della must be in March.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
January | Alberta | lovebird
February | Gladys | macaw
March | Della | finch
April | Ellen | parakeet

This solution aligns with all the clues provided in the puzzle, ensuring each month, name, and bird is uniquely matched without contradiction.","January | Alberta | macaw

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. Start with Clue 4: Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall.
  - 147 ft. | Zeke's Spruce | ?
 
 2. Analyze Clue 1: Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94 year-old tree.
  - This means the 94 year-old tree must be either 144 ft. or 150 ft. tall, as Marsh Tree must be either 147 ft. or 153 ft. tall. Since Zeke's Spruce is already 147 ft., Marsh Tree must be 153 ft. tall, and the 94 year-old tree is 150 ft. tall.
  - 150 ft. | ? | 94
  - 153 ft. | Marsh Tree | ?
 
 3. Use Clue 2: Of The Senator and Marsh Tree, one is 85 years old and the other is 153 ft. tall.
  - Since Marsh Tree is 153 ft. tall, The Senator must be 85 years old.
  - 153 ft. | Marsh Tree | 85
 
 4. Use Clue 3: The Senator is taller than the 96 year-old tree.
  - Since The Senator is 85 years old, the 96 year-old tree must be shorter than 153 ft. The only heights left are 144 ft. and 150 ft. Since 150 ft. is already taken by the 94 year-old tree, the 96 year-old tree must be 144 ft. tall.
  - 144 ft. | ? | 96
 
 5. Assign remaining tree and age:
  - The only tree left is Evan's Fir and the only age left is 94 years. Since 150 ft. is the height of the 94 year-old tree, Evan's Fir must be 150 ft. tall.
  - 150 ft. | Evan's Fir | 94
 
 6. Assign remaining tree and age for 144 ft.:
  - The only tree left is The Senator and the only age left is 96 years.
  - 144 ft. | The Senator | 96
 
 Final Answer:
 144 ft. | The Senator | 96
 147 ft. | Zeke's Spruce | 85
 150 ft. | Evan's Fir | 94
 153 ft. | Marsh Tree | 85","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Assign Known Heights**
- From clue 4, Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall.

**Step 2: Use Direct Clues**
- Clue 1 states that the Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94-year-old tree. This means the Marsh Tree cannot be the shortest tree (144 ft.) since there would be no height 3 feet shorter for the 94-year-old tree. We will find the height of the 94-year-old tree first.

**Step 3: Deduce Relationships**
- Clue 2 states that of The Senator and Marsh Tree, one is 85 years old and the other is 153 ft. tall. Since we don't know yet which is which, we'll keep this in mind.
- Clue 3 states that The Senator is taller than the 96-year-old tree. This means The Senator cannot be the shortest tree.

Given that Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. and not involved in clues 2 or 3, we can start eliminating:
- If The Senator is taller than the 96-year-old tree, and considering clue 2, The Senator cannot be 144 ft. or 147 ft. (Zeke's Spruce). The Senator must be 153 ft. tall, leaving Marsh Tree to be 85 years old.

- Since Marsh Tree is 85 years old and not 94 years old, the 94-year-old tree must be shorter than Marsh Tree. The only options left for the 94-year-old tree are 144 ft. or 150 ft. Since Marsh Tree is 3 feet taller than the 94-year-old tree (clue 1), the 94-year-old tree must be 150 ft., making Marsh Tree 153 ft. tall.

- This leaves Evan's Fir to be the remaining tree, which must be 144 ft. tall and 96 years old (since The Senator is taller than the 96-year-old tree and is 153 ft. tall).

**Step 4: Verify Consistency**
- Check all clues are satisfied with this arrangement:
  - Clue 1: Marsh Tree (153 ft.) is 3 feet taller than the 94-year-old tree (150 ft.) - Correct.
  - Clue 2: Marsh Tree is 85 years old, and The Senator is 153 ft. tall - Correct.
  - Clue 3: The Senator (153 ft.) is taller than the 96-year-old tree (144 ft.) - Correct.
  - Clue 4: Zeke's Spruce is 147 ft. tall - Correct.

prices : $550, $575, $600, $625.
companies : Banion, Cober, Dayero, Honwa.
cameras : DM-5000, FC-520, G-290, Tela G5.

Clues:
1. The camera made by Banion costs 25 dollars more than the DM-5000.
2. Of the camera made by Honwa and the camera made by Banion, one is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550.
3. The FC-520 costs 50 dollars more than the model made by Cober.

While answering use the following format:
Step-by-step solution:
Your steps showing how you are solving the puzzle
Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$550 | correct option from companies | correct option from cameras
$575 | correct option from companies | correct option from cameras
$600 | correct option from companies | correct option from cameras
$625 | correct option from companies | correct option from cameras
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
 - It states that one of the cameras made by Banion or Honwa is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550. This means either Banion or Honwa has the Tela G5 and the other has a camera costing $550.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 1
 - The camera made by Banion costs $25 more than the DM-5000. This means the DM-5000 must cost less than the camera made by Banion.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 - The FC-520 costs $50 more than the model made by Cober. This sets a relationship between the price of the FC-520 and the camera made by Cober.
 
 Step 4: Deduce from Clues
 - Since the camera made by Banion costs $25 more than the DM-5000, and one of Banion or Honwa costs $550, the DM-5000 cannot be $550 (as it would make Banion's camera $575, which doesn't fit with the Tela G5 or $550 condition). Therefore, the DM-5000 must be priced lower than $550, but since $550 is the lowest price, this is not possible. Thus, the DM-5000 cannot be the lowest price, and Banion cannot be the one with the $550 camera. Therefore, Honwa must have the $550 camera.
 
 Step 5: Assign Prices
 - Since Honwa has the $550 camera and Banion's camera costs $25 more than the DM-5000, the DM-5000 must be priced at $575 (making Banion's camera $600).
 
 Step 6: Assign Remaining Prices
 - Since the FC-520 costs $50 more than Cober's camera, and the only prices left are $625 and $575, Cober's camera must be $575 and the FC-520 must be $625.
 
 Step 7: Assign Remaining Cameras and Companies
 - Since Banion's camera is $600 and not the DM-5000 or FC-520, it must be the Tela G5. The only remaining camera for Dayero is the G-290.
 
 Final Answer:
 $550 | Honwa | G-290
 $575 | Cober | DM-5000
 $600 | Banion | Tela G5
 $625 | Dayero | FC-520","Step-by-step solution:
- From Clue 1: The camera made by Banion costs $25 more than the DM-5000. This means the DM-5000 cannot be the most expensive camera ($625) since there must be a price that is $25 more than it.
- From Clue 2: One of the cameras made by Honwa or Banion is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550. Since Banion's camera costs $25 more than the DM-5000, if DM-5000 is not the cheapest, it could be $575, making Banion's camera $600. But we need to verify this with other clues.
- From Clue 3: The FC-520 costs $50 more than the camera made by Cober. This sets a relationship that needs to be matched with available prices.

Let's assign prices:
- If DM-5000 is $575 (as it can't be the cheapest or the most expensive), then Banion's camera (which is $25 more) would be $600.
- If Banion's camera is $600, and either Banion or Honwa's camera is $550 or Tela G5, then Honwa's camera must be $550 or Tela G5. Since Banion's camera is $600, it can't be $550, so Honwa's camera is $550.
- Since Honwa's camera is $550, it can't be Tela G5 (as Banion's camera is $600 and not Tela G5), so Honwa's camera must be another model. If Banion's camera is not Tela G5, it must be another model, leaving Tela G5 to be priced differently.
- Since FC-520 is $50 more than Cober's camera, and Cober's camera can't be $575 (as DM-5000 is $575), if Cober's camera is $550, then FC-520 would be $600, which conflicts with Banion's camera. So, Cober's camera must be $575, making FC-520 $625.

Final Answer:
$550 | Honwa | G-290
$575 | Cober | DM-5000
$600 | Banion | Tela G5

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 4, we know that Lirios makes the Lectra 6.
 2. From Clue 1, the camera made by Lirios costs $25 more than the model made by Torvia.
 3. From Clue 3, either Torvia or Nectron makes the Tela G5, and one of them costs $550.
 4. From Clue 5, the Tela G5 costs $25 more than the Zenix 2C.
 
 Let's start by assigning prices:
 - If Torvia's camera costs $550, then Lirios's camera (Lectra 6) costs $575 (from Clue 1).
 - From Clue 5, if Tela G5 costs $25 more than Zenix 2C, and since we know the prices are $550, $575, $600, $625, we can deduce:
  - If Zenix 2C costs $550, Tela G5 would cost $575.
  - If Zenix 2C costs $575, Tela G5 would cost $600.
  - If Zenix 2C costs $600, Tela G5 would cost $625.
 
 Since Torvia's model costs $550 (from Clue 3), and Tela G5 or Zenix 2C must be one of these models, we can deduce:
 - Torvia's model cannot be Zenix 2C because Zenix 2C costs more than $550 (from Clue 2).
 - Therefore, Torvia's model must be Tela G5, and it costs $550.
 - Zenix 2C then costs $600 (since Tela G5 costs $25 more than Zenix 2C and Tela G5 is $550).
 
 Now, we know:
 - Torvia makes Tela G5, costing $550.
 - Lirios makes Lectra 6, costing $575.
 - Zenix 2C costs $600, but we don't know the company yet.
 
 From Clue 3, since Torvia makes Tela G5 and costs $550, Nectron must make Zenix 2C, costing $600.
 
 The remaining camera, DM-5000, costing $625, must be made by Dayero, as it's the only company and price left.
 
 Final Answer:
 $550 | Torvia | Tela G5
 $575 | Lirios | Lectra 6
 $600 | Nectron | Zenix 2C
 $625 | Dayero | DM-5000","Step-by-step solution:
- From Clue 4, we know that Lirios makes the Lectra 6.
- Clue 1 states that the camera made by Lirios costs $25 more than the model made by Torvia. Since Lirios makes the Lectra 6, the price of Lectra 6 is $25 more than Torvia's camera.
- Clue 3 tells us that one of Torvia or Nectron's cameras is the Tela G5 and the other costs $550. Since the price difference between Lirios (Lectra 6) and Torvia is $25, and the prices are $550, $575, $600, $625, Torvia's camera cannot be $625 (as it would make Lirios's camera $650, which is not an option). If Torvia's camera is $550, then Lirios's camera (Lectra 6) must be $575.
- Since Torvia's camera is not $625, and the Tela G5 costs $25 more than the Zenix 2C (Clue 5), the only way to maintain this relationship is if the Zenix 2C costs $550 and the Tela G5 costs $575. But since we already determined that Lirios's Lectra 6 costs $575, Tela G5 must cost $600 and Zenix 2C $575.
- This means Torvia's camera cannot be $550 (as it would make it the Zenix 2C, but we know it costs $575). Therefore, Nectron's camera must be $550, and Torvia's camera (Tela G5) is $600.
- The remaining camera, DM-5000, which is not yet assigned, must be made by Dayero and cost $625.

2009 | correct option from owners | correct option from breeds
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 5, the beagle won 2 years before the pekingese. This means if the beagle won in 2006, the pekingese won in 2008. If the beagle won in 2007, the pekingese won in 2009.
 
 2. From Clue 3, Elsie's canine won in 2008. If the beagle won in 2006, then the pekingese won in 2008, which would mean Elsie's dog is the pekingese.
 
 3. From Clue 1, the dog that won in 2006, the beagle, and the maltese are all different dogs. This confirms that the beagle and the pekingese are different, supporting the setup from Clue 5.
 
 4. From Clue 2, Chester's canine is either the one that won in 2006 or the beagle. Since the beagle won in 2006, Chester's dog must be the beagle.
 
 5. From Clue 4, of the dog that won in 2009 and the dog that won in 2006, one is the pekingese and the other is Fernando's. Since the pekingese won in 2008 (from Clue 5 and Clue 3), Fernando's dog must have won in 2009.

 2006 | Chester | beagle
 2007 | Barbara | maltese
 2008 | Elsie | pekingese
 2009 | Fernando | great dane","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Identify Direct Clues**
- Clue 3 directly states that Elsie's canine won in 2008.

**Step 2: Use Process of Elimination**
- From Clue 5, the beagle won 2 years before the pekingese. Since the beagle must have won 2 years before the pekingese, the only years that fit this description are 2006 for the beagle and 2008 for the pekingese. However, since Elsie's dog won in 2008 and it's a different dog from the beagle (Clue 1), the beagle must have won in 2007 and the pekingese in 2009.

**Step 3: Cross-Reference Clues**
- Clue 2 states Chester's canine is either the canine that won in 2006 or the beagle. Since the beagle won in 2007, Chester's dog must be the one from 2006.
- Clue 4 states that of the canine that won in 2009 and the dog that won in 2006, one is the pekingese and the other is Fernando's. Since the pekingese won in 2009, Fernando's dog must be the one from 2006.

**Step 4: Confirm Remaining Options**
- Since Fernando's dog is from 2006 and Chester's dog is also from 2006, and Fernando's dog is not the beagle (as the beagle won in 2007), Fernando's dog must be the maltese (from Clue 1, the beagle, maltese, and 2006 winner are all different dogs).
- This leaves Barbara and the great dane for 2007, as all other breeds and owners for 2007 have been accounted for.

**Step 5: Finalize the Grid**

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, the March account and the sighting at Laurel Grove are different events. This means that if one is in March, the other is not.
 
 2. From Clue 1, either Francis's account or the sighting at Laurel Grove happened in March, and the other in May. Since from Clue 3, March and Laurel Grove are different events, Laurel Grove must be in May, and Francis's account must be in March.
 
 3. From Clue 5, the sighting at Seryl Forest was either Wanda's event or the June event. Since we know Francis's account is in March, Wanda's event must be in June at Seryl Forest.
 
 4. From Clue 2, Hannah's event took place 2 months after the account at Seryl Forest. Since Seryl Forest is in June, Hannah's event must be in August, but since we only have months up to June, we need to adjust. Since Seryl Forest is in June, and Hannah's event is 2 months after, this means Seryl Forest must be in April, and Hannah's event is in June. However, we already established Wanda's event in June at Seryl Forest. This means Seryl Forest must be in April, and Hannah's event is in June at another location.
 
 5. From Clue 4, the account at Juniper Springs was either the April sighting or Hannah's sighting. Since Seryl Forest is in April, Juniper Springs must be Hannah's sighting in June.
 
 6. The only remaining month for Jenny is May, and the only remaining location for May (Laurel Grove already assigned) is Bald Hill Run.
 
 Final Answer:
 March | Francis | Juniper Springs
 April | Wanda | Seryl Forest
 May | Jenny | Laurel Grove
 June | Hannah | Bald Hill Run","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Of the sighting at Laurel Grove and Francis's account, one happened in March and the other in May.
- This means Laurel Grove and Francis are either in March or May, but not in the same month.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- The March account and the sighting at Laurel Grove were different events.
- Since Laurel Grove cannot be in March, it must be in May. Therefore, Francis's account is in March.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 5**
- The sighting at Seryl Forest was either Wanda's event or the June event.
- Since no other information contradicts this, we keep both possibilities open for now.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Hannah's event took place 2 months after the account at Seryl Forest.
- If Seryl Forest is in June, Hannah's event would be in August, which is not listed. Therefore, Seryl Forest cannot be in June. It must be in April, placing Hannah's event in June.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 4**
- The account at Juniper Springs was either the April sighting or Hannah's sighting.
- Since Hannah's event is in June, Juniper Springs cannot be Hannah's sighting. Therefore, Juniper Springs is the April sighting.

**Step 6: Assign Remaining Options**
- With Francis in March, Laurel Grove in May, Seryl Forest in April, and Hannah in June, the remaining witness for May is Jenny.
- The remaining location for March is Bald Hill Run, and since Seryl Forest is in April, Wanda, linked to Seryl Forest, must be the witness in April.

 The four babies were Maxine, the child born at 12:10am, the Blanchards' baby, and the baby born at 12:07am. Since the Underwoods' baby was born at 12:07am, the Blanchards' baby must be either Maxine or the child born at 12:10am.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
 Of the Ortegas' child and the baby born at 12:10am, one was Luis and the other was Susan. Since the baby born at 12:10am is either Maxine or the Blanchards' baby, it cannot be Susan or Luis. Therefore, the Ortegas' child must be either Susan or Luis, and the baby born at 12:10am must be Maxine or the Blanchards' baby.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
 The Ortegas' baby was either Susan or the child born at 12:04am. Since the Ortegas' baby is either Susan or Luis, and the baby born at 12:10am is not Susan or Luis, the Ortegas' baby must be Susan, and she must be born at 12:04am.
 
 Step 5: Deduce Remaining Information
 - Peggy was born at 12:01am, and the Underwoods' baby was born at 12:07am.
 - Susan is the Ortegas' baby and was born at 12:04am.
 - The baby born at 12:10am must be Maxine, and since the Blanchards' baby is either Maxine or the baby born at 12:10am, Maxine is the Blanchards' baby.
 - The only remaining name and family for the baby born at 12:07am are Luis and Underwood.
 
 Final Answer:
 12:01am | Peggy | Vaughan
 12:04am | Susan | Ortega
 12:07am | Luis | Underwood
 12:10am | Maxine | Blanchard","### Step-by-step solution:

**Clue 1: Peggy was born 6 minutes before the Underwoods' baby.**
- This clue directly places Peggy at 12:01am and the Underwoods' baby at 12:07am.

**Clue 2: The Ortegas' baby was either Susan or the child born at 12:04am.**
- We keep this information for cross-referencing with other clues.

**Clue 3: The four babies were Maxine, the child born at 12:10am, the Blanchards' baby, and the baby born at 12:07am.**
- From Clue 1, the baby born at 12:07am is the Underwoods' baby. Therefore, Maxine, the Blanchards' baby, and the child born at 12:10am are the remaining options for the other times.

**Clue 4: Of the Ortegas' child and the baby born at 12:10am, one was Luis and the other was Susan.**
- Since the Ortegas' baby could be Susan or the child born at 12:04am, and one of the Ortegas' child or the baby born at 12:10am is Susan or Luis, we can deduce that if the Ortegas' baby is Susan, then the baby born at 12:10am is Luis, and vice versa.

Given the above deductions:
- Peggy at 12:01am, Underwoods at 12:07am.
- Ortegas' baby is either Susan or at 12:04am.
- Maxine and Blanchards' baby are at 12:04am or 12:10am.
- Luis or Susan is at 12:10am.

Since Peggy is at 12:01am, and the Underwoods' baby is at 12:07am, and the Ortegas' baby is either Susan or at 12:04am, we can deduce:
- Ortegas' baby is Susan at 12:04am.
- Luis is the baby at 12:10am.
- Maxine is the Blanchards' baby at 12:07am.

Using only the clues below, match the years to the options from islands and cultures. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

years : 1754, 1761, 1768, 1775.
islands : Fushil, Nuhirk, Verinya, Zafet.
cultures : Enakai, Manika'i, Kukani, Wainani.

Clues:
1. Zafet was either the island on which the Kukani people lived or the island on which the Manika'i people lived.
2. Of the island on which the Kukani people lived and the island on which the Wainani people lived, one was discovered in 1761 and the other was Nuhirk.
3. Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk.
4. The island on which the Enakai people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived.
5. Fushil was either the island discovered in 1768 or the island discovered in 1754.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1754 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1761 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1768 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
1775 | correct option from islands | correct option from cultures
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 3, Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk. This means if we place Nuhirk in 1775, Verinya would be in 1768. If Nuhirk is in 1768, Verinya would be in 1761, and so on. We need to keep this in mind as we proceed.
 
 2. From Clue 5, Fushil was either discovered in 1768 or 1754. We'll consider both possibilities as we continue.
 
 3. From Clue 2, one of the islands where Kukani or Wainani lived was discovered in 1761, and the other was Nuhirk. This means Nuhirk cannot be in 1761 because it would contradict the clue. If Nuhirk is in 1775, then the island discovered in 1761 must be where either Kukani or Wainani lived.
 
 4. From Clue 1, Zafet was either where Kukani or Manika'i lived. Since we know from Clue 2 that either Kukani or Wainani was discovered in 1761, and Zafet is not mentioned in Clue 2, Zafet cannot be the island discovered in 1761.
 
 5. From Clue 4, the island where Enakai lived was discovered after the island where Manika'i lived. This means Manika'i's island must be one of the earlier ones.
 
 6. Let's place Nuhirk in 1775 (as it fits with Verinya being discovered 7 years earlier, which would be 1768). This means Verinya cannot be where Kukani or Wainani lived (since one of them is in 1761). Therefore, Verinya must be where Enakai lived, and Fushil must be in 1754.
 
 7. Since Verinya (1768) is where Enakai lived, and it must be after Manika'i's island, Manika'i cannot be in 1775. If we place Manika'i in 1761, then Zafet must be the island discovered in 1761 (since Zafet is either Kukani or Manika'i, and Kukani or Wainani is in 1761).
 
 8. This leaves Kukani in 1761 on Zafet, and Wainani must be on Nuhirk in 1775.
 
 Final Answer:
 1754 | Fushil | (not yet determined)
 1761 | Zafet | Kukani
 1768 | Verinya | Enakai
 1775 | Nuhirk | Wainani
 
 We still need to determine the culture for Fushil in 1754. Since all other cultures are assigned, Fushil must be where the remaining culture, Manika'i, lived.
 
 Final Answer:
 1754 | Fushil | Manika'i
 1761 | Zafet | Kukani
 1768 | Verinya | Enakai
 1775 | Nuhirk | Wainani","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Apply Direct Clues and Process of Elimination**
- Clue 5 states that Fushil was either discovered in 1768 or 1754. We'll keep this in mind as we proceed.

**Step 2: Use Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that Verinya was discovered 7 years before Nuhirk. This means if we place Nuhirk in a year, Verinya must be exactly 7 years earlier. The only possible years that fit this 7-year gap are 1768 for Nuhirk and 1761 for Verinya.

**Step 3: Apply Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that of the island on which the Kukani people lived and the island on which the Wainani people lived, one was discovered in 1761 and the other was Nuhirk. Since Nuhirk is in 1768, the island discovered in 1761 must be where the Kukani or Wainani people lived. Since Verinya is in 1761, it must be one of these cultures.

**Step 4: Use Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that Zafet was either the island on which the Kukani people lived or the island on which the Manika'i people lived. Since Verinya is already assigned to either Kukani or Wainani, Zafet must be the other option between Kukani or Manika'i.

**Step 5: Apply Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that the island on which the Enakai people lived was discovered sometime after the island on which the Manika'i people lived. Since Zafet is either Kukani or Manika'i, and Verinya is either Kukani or Wainani, and Nuhirk is not associated with these clues directly, Enakai must be on Fushil, and it must be in 1775 (the only year left after placing other islands).

**Step 6: Finalize the Grid**
- Since Fushil is either 1768 or 1754 and Enakai is in 1775, Fushil must be in 1754. This leaves 1768 for Nuhirk.
- Verinya in 1761 must be associated with Wainani (since Zafet is either Kukani or Manika'i and Nuhirk is not associated with these cultures).
- Zafet, therefore, must be associated with Kukani in 1775.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.

Clues:
1. Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez and the game released in May are all different apps.
2. Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic.
3. Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
March | correct option from games | correct option from developers
April | correct option from games | correct option from developers
May | correct option from games | correct option from developers
June | correct option from games | correct option from developers
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, we know that Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez, and the game released in May are all different apps. This means that Vitalinks is not released by BeGamez and not released in May.
 
 2. From Clue 2, Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic. This means Wizard World cannot be released in March, and Apptastic's game cannot be released in June.
 
 3. From Clue 3, Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka. This means Angry Ants cannot be released in June, and Peter Parka cannot be released in March.
 
 4. From Clue 4, of Peter Parka and the application released in May, one was made by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo. This means that either Peter Parka or the May release is by Apptastic, and the other is by Gadingo.
 
 Let's start placing the games:
 - Since Wizard World is released 1 month after Apptastic's game, and Apptastic's game cannot be in June, Apptastic's game must be in either March, April, or May. Wizard World then must be in either April, May, or June.
 - Since Angry Ants is 1 month before Peter Parka, and Peter Parka cannot be in March, Angry Ants cannot be in June. If Angry Ants is in March, Peter Parka must be in April.
 
 Let's assign:
 - Angry Ants in March, Peter Parka in April.
 
 Now, since Peter Parka is in April and one of Peter Parka or May's game is by Apptastic, Apptastic cannot be in May. If Apptastic is in March, Wizard World would be in April, but Peter Parka is already there. So, Apptastic must be in April (Peter Parka), and Wizard World in May. This leaves Gadingo for May.
 
 Now, since BeGamez cannot be in May and Vitalinks is not by BeGamez or in May, BeGamez must be in June. This leaves Vortia for March.
 
 Final Answer:
 March | Angry Ants | Vortia
 April | Peter Parka | Apptastic
 May | Wizard World | Gadingo
 June | Vitalinks | BeGamez","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Understand the Clues**
We have four months, four games, and four developers. Each month will have one unique game and one unique developer associated with it.

**Step 2: Initial Deductions**
- Clue 3 states that Angry Ants was released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka. This means Angry Ants cannot be in June and Peter Parka cannot be in March.

**Step 3: Cross-Referencing**
- Clue 2 states that Wizard World was released 1 month later than the application released by Apptastic. This means Wizard World cannot be in March and Apptastic's game cannot be in June.

**Step 4: Process of Elimination**
- Clue 1 states that Vitalinks, the game released by BeGamez, and the game released in May are all different apps. This means that if one of these is assigned to a month, the other two cannot be in the same month.
- Clue 4 states that of Peter Parka and the application released in May, one was made by Apptastic and the other by Gadingo. This means neither can be associated with BeGamez or Vortia.

**Step 5: Further Deductions**
- Since Angry Ants is released 1 month earlier than Peter Parka, and considering the constraints from Clue 4, if Peter Parka is in May (and thus could be developed by Apptastic or Gadingo), Angry Ants must be in April.
- From Clue 2, if Wizard World is released 1 month later than Apptastic's game, and considering Peter Parka could be Apptastic's game in May, Wizard World would then be in June.

**Step 6: Final Assignments**
- With Angry Ants in April and not developed by Apptastic (as it's not Peter Parka), and Wizard World in June, developed by someone other than Apptastic or Gadingo (from Clue 4), we can deduce:
  - March: Vitalinks by BeGamez (since it's different from the May game and developer, and BeGamez isn't mentioned with other months).
  - April: Angry Ants by Vortia (since BeGamez is taken by Vitalinks and Gadingo and Apptastic are for May).
  - May: Peter Parka by Apptastic (from Clue 4).
  - June: Wizard World by Gadingo (remaining game and developer).

10:00am | correct option from teams | correct option from locations
11:00am | correct option from teams | correct option from locations
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 4 first, which states that Charlie Group deployed 1 hour before India Group. This means Charlie Group could be at either 8:00am or 9:00am, and India Group would then be at either 9:00am or 10:00am respectively.
 
 Step 2: Clue 3 states that of the team that jumped at 9:00am and the squad that jumped at 10:00am, one is India Group and the other was dropped at Crestline X. Since we know from Step 1 that India Group could be at 9:00am or 10:00am, we can deduce that if India is at 9:00am, then Crestline X is at 10:00am, and vice versa.
 
 Step 3: Clue 2 states that of the squad that dropped at Anthon Ridge and the team that jumped at 10:00am, one is Foxtrot Group and the other is India Group. Since we know from Step 2 that India Group could be at 10:00am, it means Foxtrot Group must be at Anthon Ridge, and thus India Group is at 10:00am.
 
 Step 4: From Step 3, since India Group is at 10:00am, from Clue 3, Crestline X must be at 9:00am. Therefore, the team at 9:00am is not India but the other option, which must be Whiskey Group (since Foxtrot is at Anthon Ridge and Charlie is 1 hour before India).
 
 Step 5: From Step 1 and Step 4, since Charlie Group is 1 hour before India Group and India Group is at 10:00am, Charlie Group must be at 9:00am. But from Step 4, Whiskey is at 9:00am, so Charlie must be at 8:00am.
 
 Step 6: The remaining team for 11:00am must be Foxtrot Group, and the remaining location for 8:00am must be Ezra Forest (from Clue 1, since Charlie is at 8:00am and one option for Charlie was Ezra Forest).
 
 Step 7: The remaining location for 11:00am must be Frazier Park.
 
 Final Answer:
 8:00am | Charlie | Ezra Forest
 9:00am | Whiskey | Crestline X
 10:00am | India | Anthon Ridge
 11:00am | Foxtrot | Frazier Park","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- Charlie Group deployed 1 hour before India Group.
- This means Charlie cannot be at 11:00am and India cannot be at 8:00am.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**
- Charlie Group is either at 8:00am or at Ezra Forest.
- Since Charlie cannot be at 11:00am, if Charlie is not at 8:00am, then Charlie must be at Ezra Forest.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the squad at Anthon Ridge and the team at 10:00am, one is Foxtrot Group and the other is India Group.
- Since India cannot be at 8:00am, India could be at 10:00am or at Anthon Ridge.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the team at 9:00am and the team at 10:00am, one is India Group and the other is at Crestline X.
- If India is at 10:00am, then the team at 9:00am must be at Crestline X.

**Step 5: Deductions from Steps 1-4**
- If Charlie is at 8:00am, then India must be at 10:00am (from Clue 4).
- If India is at 10:00am, then 9:00am is Crestline X (from Clue 3).
- If 9:00am is Crestline X, then Foxtrot cannot be at 10:00am (from Clue 2), so Foxtrot must be at Anthon Ridge.
- This leaves Whiskey Group for the remaining slot.

**Step 6: Fill in the remaining details**
- Charlie at 8:00am means Charlie cannot be at Ezra Forest, so Charlie must be at another location.
- Since Foxtrot is at Anthon Ridge, and Crestline X is at 9:00am, the remaining locations for Charlie are Frazier Park or Ezra Forest.
- Since Charlie is either at 8:00am or Ezra Forest, Charlie must be at Ezra Forest at 8:00am.
- Whiskey Group must be at 11:00am at Frazier Park.

274 | correct option from sailors | correct option from boat types
278 | correct option from sailors | correct option from boat types
282 | correct option from sailors | correct option from boat types
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 Wendell Orr either finished in 270 days or was in the gaff cutter.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop finished either in 270 days or 278 days.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 Tara Carroll took 4 more days to finish than Ed Alexander.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 The sailor in the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days to finish than Ed Alexander.
 
 Step 5: Deduce from Clue 4 and Clue 3
 If the pilot cutter sailor took 4 fewer days than Ed Alexander, and Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed Alexander, then Ed Alexander cannot be the pilot cutter sailor. This means Tara Carroll cannot be the pilot cutter sailor either, as the difference in their days is exactly 8 days.
 
 Step 6: Assign days based on Clue 4
 If Ed Alexander is not in the pilot cutter, and the pilot cutter sailor took 4 fewer days than Ed Alexander, we need to find a pair of days that are 4 days apart. The possible pairs are (270, 274), (274, 278), and (278, 282). Since Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed Alexander, and their difference is 8 days, Ed Alexander must be in one of the middle days (274 or 278).
 
 Step 7: Assign days to Tara Carroll
 If Ed Alexander took 274 days, Tara Carroll took 282 days. If Ed Alexander took 278 days, Tara Carroll took 286 days (which is not an option). Therefore, Ed Alexander took 274 days, and Tara Carroll took 282 days.
 
 Step 8: Assign boat types
 Since Ed Alexander took 274 days and the pilot cutter took 4 fewer days, the pilot cutter finished in 270 days. Wendell Orr was either 270 days or in the gaff cutter. Since 270 days is taken by the pilot cutter, Wendell Orr must be in the gaff cutter.
 
 Step 9: Assign remaining sailor to 270 days
 Since the pilot cutter finished in 270 days and it's not Wendell Orr, it must be Vicky Estes or the competitor in the sloop. From Clue 2, Vicky Estes and the sloop finished either in 270 or 278 days. Since the pilot cutter is not a sloop, Vicky Estes must be in the pilot cutter.
 
 Step 10: Assign remaining days and boat types
 Wendell Orr is in the gaff cutter, and the only remaining day is 278. The sloop then must be the remaining boat type for 278 days, which means the competitor in the sloop is Ed Alexander. The only remaining sailor for 278 days is Tara Carroll, but she is already assigned 282 days. Thus, Wendell Orr must be 278 days, and the remaining sailor, Tara Carroll, must be in the schooner at 282 days.
 
 Final Answer:
 270 | Vicky Estes | pilot cutter
 274 | Ed Alexander | sloop
 278 | Wendell Orr | gaff cutter
 282 | Tara Carroll | schooner","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Wendell Orr was either the sailor who finished in 270 days or the person in the gaff cutter.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of Vicky Estes and the competitor in the sloop, one finished in 270 days and the other finished in 278 days.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**

- Since Tara Carroll took 4 more days than Ed Alexander, and the days are 270, 274, 278, and 282, Tara and Ed must be associated with consecutive time slots that differ by 4 days.
- From Clue 4, the pilot cutter also must be associated with a time slot 4 days before one of Ed's possible slots.

**Step 6: Further Deductions**
- If Wendell Orr was in the gaff cutter or finished in 270 days, and considering the pilot cutter finishes 4 days before Ed, Wendell cannot be in the pilot cutter.
- Since Vicky Estes and the sloop competitor are either 270 or 278, and Wendell Orr is either 270 or in the gaff cutter, if Wendell is not in the sloop, then Vicky Estes cannot be in 278 if she is not in the sloop.

**Step 7: Placing Sailors and Boats**
- If Wendell Orr is in 270 days, he cannot be in the sloop (as it must be either 270 or 278). Thus, he must be in the gaff cutter.
- If Wendell is in the gaff cutter at 270, then the sloop must be at 278.
- Ed Alexander cannot be at 278 (as he would be in the sloop), so he must be at 274 or 282. Since Tara Carroll takes 4 more days, she must be at 278 or 282. Since 278 is taken by the sloop, Ed must be at 274 and Tara at 282.
- The pilot cutter, taking 4 fewer days than Ed, must be at 270.

**Step 8: Final Placement**
- Wendell Orr is in the gaff cutter at 270.
- Ed Alexander is at 274, and the pilot cutter is at 270, so Vicky Estes must be at 278 in the sloop.
- Tara Carroll is at 282 in the remaining boat type, the schooner.

**Final Answer:**

teams : Night Ninjas, Oil Crew, Splat Squad, Target Bombs.
colors : orange, purple, red, yellow.

Clues:
1. The ""Night Ninjas"" was ranked 1 place ahead of the ""Oil Crew"".
2. The ""Splat Squad"", the purple team and the team that finished third are all different teams.
3. Of the ""Oil Crew"" and the group that finished third, one uses orange paintballs and the other uses red paintballs.
4. The ""Target Bombs"" was ranked 1 place behind the orange team.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
first | correct option from teams | correct option from colors
second | correct option from teams | correct option from colors
third | correct option from teams | correct option from colors
fourth | correct option from teams | correct option from colors
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 - The ""Night Ninjas"" was ranked 1 place ahead of the ""Oil Crew"". This means if Night Ninjas are in position n, then Oil Crew is in position n+1.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
 - The ""Target Bombs"" was ranked 1 place behind the orange team. This means if the orange team is in position m, then Target Bombs are in position m+1.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 - Of the ""Oil Crew"" and the group that finished third, one uses orange paintballs and the other uses red paintballs. Since we know from Clue 1 that Oil Crew is directly after Night Ninjas, and from Clue 4 that Target Bombs is directly after the orange team, we can deduce that Oil Crew and the third place team must be either orange or red.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
 - The ""Splat Squad"", the purple team, and the team that finished third are all different teams. This means Splat Squad cannot be third or purple.
 
 Step 5: Deduction from Clues 1, 3, and 4
 - If Oil Crew is orange, then they cannot be third (as per Clue 3). Therefore, the third team must be red. This means Oil Crew is orange and not third. Since Night Ninjas are ahead of Oil Crew, Night Ninjas cannot be first. Therefore, Night Ninjas are second, Oil Crew is third (orange), and the first team must be the one ahead of Night Ninjas.
 
 Step 6: Deduction from Clue 2 and previous steps
 - Since Splat Squad is neither third nor purple, and since Oil Crew is orange and third, Splat Squad must be first or fourth. Since Night Ninjas are second and not purple, and Oil Crew is orange, Splat Squad must be purple and cannot be third, so they are fourth.
 
 Step 7: Final placements
 - Since Splat Squad is purple and fourth, and Oil Crew is orange and third, the first team must be the one that is not Night Ninjas, Oil Crew, or Splat Squad, which is Target Bombs. Since Target Bombs is behind the orange team, the only color left for Target Bombs is yellow. Night Ninjas must then be red.
 
 Final Answer:
 first | Target Bombs | yellow
 second | Night Ninjas | red
 third | Oil Crew | orange
 fourth | Splat Squad | purple","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
- The ""Night Ninjas"" was ranked 1 place ahead of the ""Oil Crew"".
  This means if Night Ninjas are in any position, Oil Crew must be directly after them.

Step 2: Analyze Clue 4
- The ""Target Bombs"" was ranked 1 place behind the orange team.
  This means if any team is orange, Target Bombs must be directly after them.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
- The ""Splat Squad"", the purple team, and the team that finished third are all different teams.
  This means Splat Squad cannot be third, cannot be purple, and the third team cannot be purple.

Step 4: Analyze Clue 3
- Of the ""Oil Crew"" and the group that finished third, one uses orange paintballs and the other uses red paintballs.
  Since they are different and one of them is third, we can start positioning them with colors.

Step 5: Deductions from Clues
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, if Night Ninjas are first, Oil Crew must be second. If Oil Crew is second and one of Oil Crew or third uses orange and the other uses red, and since Target Bombs follow the orange team, we can deduce:
  If Oil Crew is second and uses orange, Target Bombs must be third and use another color, but Clue 3 says third cannot be purple, so Target Bombs cannot be purple.
  If third is orange, then Target Bombs must be fourth.

Step 6: Further Deductions
- Since Splat Squad cannot be third or purple and cannot be the same as the third team, we can deduce:
  If Night Ninjas are first and not purple, and Oil Crew is second and orange, then Splat Squad can be fourth and not purple or third. If Target Bombs follow orange, they must be fourth if third is orange.

Step 7: Final Positioning
- Night Ninjas are first (not purple), Oil Crew is second and orange, Target Bombs are fourth, and Splat Squad is third (not purple). Since third cannot be purple, and Splat Squad is not purple, the only remaining color for Splat Squad is red. Therefore, Target Bombs must be purple.

$3.40 | correct option from customers | correct option from orders
$3.50 | correct option from customers | correct option from orders
$3.60 | correct option from customers | correct option from orders
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, we know that either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink and one of them ordered the iced americano. 
 
 2. From Clue 1, Darrell's drink cost 20 cents less than Charlie's. Since Charlie's drink could be either $3.60 or the one costing 20 cents less than $3.60, we can calculate the possible prices for Darrell's drink. If Charlie's drink is $3.60, Darrell's drink would be $3.40.
 
 3. From Clue 3, Jacob's drink cost 20 cents less than the espresso. This means the espresso must be more expensive than Jacob's drink by 20 cents.
 
 4. From Clue 4, the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink. Since Darrell's drink is $3.40, the vanilla latte must be more than $3.40.
 
 5. Since the vanilla latte costs more than $3.40 and must be more than Darrell's drink, it can only be $3.50 or $3.60. But since either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink, and it's either the iced americano or another drink, the vanilla latte must be $3.50.
 
 6. Since the vanilla latte is $3.50, and it's not ordered by Darrell, Charlie, or Henry (as per Clue 2 and the price), it must be ordered by Jacob.
 
 7. Since Jacob ordered the vanilla latte at $3.50, and Jacob's drink is 20 cents less than the espresso (Clue 3), the espresso must be $3.70, but since $3.70 is not an option, we need to adjust. Since Jacob's drink is $3.50, the espresso must be $3.60.
 
 8. Since the espresso is $3.60, and it's not ordered by Jacob, it must be ordered by either Henry or Charlie. Since Charlie's drink costs more than Darrell's and Darrell's is $3.40, Charlie's drink must be $3.60. Therefore, Charlie ordered the espresso.
 
 9. Since Charlie ordered the espresso at $3.60, and Henry or Charlie ordered the iced americano, Henry must have ordered the iced americano. The only price left for the iced americano is $3.40.
 
 10. The only remaining customer and drink combination is Darrell with the macchiato at $3.30.
 
 Final Answer:
 $3.30 | Darrell | macchiato
 $3.40 | Henry | iced americano
 $3.50 | Jacob | vanilla latte
 $3.60 | Charlie | espresso","Let's correct the errors and solve the puzzle accurately:

Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 1, Darrell's drink costs 20 cents less than Charlie's drink. This means if Charlie's drink is $3.60, Darrell's drink would be $3.40. If Charlie's drink is $3.50, Darrell's drink would be $3.30, and so on.

2. From Clue 2, we know that either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink and one of them ordered the iced americano. This means the $3.60 drink and the iced americano are linked to Henry and Charlie.

3. From Clue 3, Jacob's drink costs 20 cents less than the espresso. This means Jacob's drink could be $3.30 if the espresso is $3.50, or $3.40 if the espresso is $3.60.

4. From Clue 4, the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink. This means the vanilla latte cannot be the cheapest drink.

Using these clues, let's deduce:
- If Charlie's drink is $3.60, then Darrell's drink is $3.40. Since the vanilla latte costs more than Darrell's drink, it cannot be $3.30, so it must be either $3.50 or $3.60. But if the vanilla latte is $3.60, it contradicts the fact that either Henry or Charlie ordered the $3.60 drink. Therefore, the vanilla latte must be $3.50.

- Since the vanilla latte is $3.50 and costs more than Darrell's drink ($3.40), and Jacob's drink costs 20 cents less than the espresso, the only price left for the espresso that fits is $3.60. Therefore, Jacob's drink, costing 20 cents less, is $3.40.

- This means Darrell's drink cannot be $3.40 as it would be the same as Jacob's. Therefore, Darrell's drink must be $3.30, and Charlie's drink is $3.60. Since Charlie's drink is $3.60, Henry must have ordered the iced americano.

- The remaining drink price for Darrell is $3.30, and the only drink left is the macchiato.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$3.30 | Darrell | macchiato

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
$2 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
$5 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
$8 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
$11 million | correct option from movies | correct option from directors
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, Amerigo made $6 million less than the movie directed by Hick Harmon.
 2. From Clue 2, Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo.
 3. From Clue 4, either the movie directed by Nan Norman or Easy to Love made $11 million, and the other made $2 million.
 
 Let's start by determining the earnings of Amerigo and Zephyr Breeze:
 - If Amerigo made $2 million, then Zephyr Breeze made $2 million + $6 million = $8 million.
 - If Amerigo made $5 million, then Zephyr Breeze made $5 million + $6 million = $11 million.
 - Amerigo cannot have made $8 million or $11 million because Zephyr Breeze would then exceed the maximum earnings of $11 million.
 
 Let's analyze the possibilities:
 - If Amerigo made $2 million, then Zephyr Breeze made $8 million.
 - If Amerigo made $5 million, then Zephyr Breeze made $11 million.
 
 Now, let's use Clue 1:
 - If Amerigo made $2 million, then the movie directed by Hick Harmon made $2 million + $6 million = $8 million.
 - If Amerigo made $5 million, then the movie directed by Hick Harmon made $5 million + $6 million = $11 million.
 
 Now, let's use Clue 4:
 - If Nan Norman directed a movie that made $11 million, then Easy to Love made $2 million, or vice versa.
 
 Let's consider the earnings of $11 million:
 - If Zephyr Breeze made $11 million, then Amerigo made $5 million, and Hick Harmon directed a movie that made $11 million. This fits with Amerigo making $5 million and Zephyr Breeze making $11 million.
 
 Now, let's use Clue 3:
 - Micah Moreno's movie made somewhat more than Tippecanoe. If Tippecanoe made $2 million, then Micah Moreno's movie could be the one that made $5 million.
 
 Finalizing the directors:
 - Hick Harmon directed Zephyr Breeze ($11 million).
 - Micah Moreno directed Amerigo ($5 million).
 - Nan Norman and Easy to Love are left with $2 million and $8 million. Since one of them must be $11 million or $2 million, Nan Norman directed the movie that made $2 million, and Easy to Love made $8 million.
 - Odette Olson directed Tippecanoe ($2 million).
 
 Final Answer:
 $2 million | Tippecanoe | Odette Olson
 $5 million | Amerigo | Micah Moreno
 $8 million | Easy to Love | Nan Norman
 $11 million | Zephyr Breeze | Hick Harmon","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clues**
- Clue 1: Amerigo made $6 million less than the movie directed by Hick Harmon.
- Clue 2: Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo.
- Clue 3: The movie directed by Micah Moreno made somewhat more than Tippecanoe.
- Clue 4: Of the movie directed by Nan Norman and Easy to Love, one made $11 million and the other made $2 million.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning**
- From Clue 4, we know that either the movie directed by Nan Norman or Easy to Love made $11 million, and the other made $2 million. We need more information to determine which is which.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 2, we can start to deduce the earnings of Amerigo and Zephyr Breeze. Since Zephyr Breeze made $6 million more than Amerigo, and the earnings options are $2 million, $5 million, $8 million, and $11 million, Amerigo cannot have made $8 million or $11 million because Zephyr Breeze would then exceed the available earnings options. If Amerigo made $2 million, Zephyr Breeze would have made $8 million.
- If Amerigo made $2 million and Zephyr Breeze made $8 million, then from Clue 1, the movie directed by Hick Harmon would have made $8 million (Amerigo + $6 million). This is not possible as Zephyr Breeze already has the $8 million slot. Therefore, Amerigo must make $5 million, and Zephyr Breeze makes $11 million. Consequently, Hick Harmon's movie must be $11 million.

**Step 3: Cross-Referencing**
- With Amerigo at $5 million and Zephyr Breeze at $11 million directed by Hick Harmon, we now know from Clue 4 that Easy to Love and the movie directed by Nan Norman are left with $2 million and $8 million. Since one of these must be $11 million and that slot is taken, Easy to Love must be $2 million and Nan Norman's movie must be $8 million.
- Clue 3 states that Micah Moreno's movie made somewhat more than Tippecanoe. Since the only remaining earnings higher than another is $8 million (Nan Norman's movie) over $5 million (Amerigo), Micah Moreno must direct the movie that made $8 million, and Tippecanoe must be the movie that made $5 million.

**Step 4: Fill the Table**
- $2 million | Easy to Love | Odette Olson
- $5 million | Tippecanoe | Nan Norman
- $8 million | Amerigo | Micah Moreno
- $11 million | Zephyr Breeze | Hick Harmon

Final Answer:

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 - The film that grossed $5 million and the film that grossed $8 million are between Fast and Dead and a film directed by Linda Lynch. 
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 - Amerigo made $3 million less than Fast and Dead.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 - Amerigo either grossed $2 million or was directed by Nan Norman.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 - Between the film directed by Hick Harmon and the film that grossed $8 million, one is Easy to Love and the other is Fast and Dead.
 
 Step 5: Deductions
 - From Clue 4 and Clue 1, if Fast and Dead is one of the films that grossed $8 million or $5 million, and it's also either Easy to Love or directed by Hick Harmon, we can deduce that Fast and Dead did not gross $8 million (as it would conflict with it being Easy to Love or directed by Hick Harmon). Therefore, Fast and Dead grossed $5 million.
 - Linda Lynch directed the film that grossed $8 million (from Clue 1), which is not Fast and Dead, so it must be another movie.
 
 Step 6: More Deductions
 - From Clue 2 and the deduction that Fast and Dead grossed $5 million, Amerigo must have grossed $2 million (as it made $3 million less than Fast and Dead).
 - From Clue 3, since Amerigo grossed $2 million, it is not directed by Nan Norman.
 
 Step 7: Assigning Directors
 - Since Amerigo is not directed by Nan Norman and it grossed $2 million, Nan Norman must have directed another film. Since Linda Lynch directed the $8 million film, and Fast and Dead is directed by Hick Harmon (from Clue 4), Nan Norman must direct What a World.
 
 Step 8: Final Earnings and Directors
 - The remaining film, Easy to Love, must be the one that grossed $11 million and is directed by Odette Olson (as all other directors and earnings are accounted for).
 
 Final Answer:

 $5 million | Fast and Dead | Linda Lynch
 $8 million | What a World | Nan Norman
 $11 million | Easy to Love | Odette Olson","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- Clue 1 states that between the film that grossed $5 million and the film that grossed $8 million, one is ""Fast and Dead"" and the other was directed by Linda Lynch.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- Clue 2 states that ""Amerigo"" made $3 million less than ""Fast and Dead"". This means if ""Fast and Dead"" made $8 million, then ""Amerigo"" made $5 million. If ""Fast and Dead"" made $5 million, then ""Amerigo"" made $2 million.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- Clue 3 states that ""Amerigo"" is either the film that grossed $2 million or the film directed by Nan Norman.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Clue 4 states that of the film directed by Hick Harmon and the film that grossed $8 million, one is ""Easy to Love"" and the other is ""Fast and Dead"".

**Step 5: Deductions and Cross-referencing**
- From Clue 2 and Clue 3, if ""Amerigo"" made $2 million, it fits both clues. Thus, ""Amerigo"" grossed $2 million.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 4, if ""Fast and Dead"" grossed $8 million, then it fits both clues. Thus, ""Fast and Dead"" grossed $8 million and was directed by Linda Lynch (from Clue 1).
- From Clue 4, since ""Fast and Dead"" is $8 million, ""Easy to Love"" must be directed by Hick Harmon.
- From Clue 3, since ""Amerigo"" grossed $2 million, it must be directed by Nan Norman (the only option left that fits).

 - Since the only remaining distances are 165 ft and 180 ft, Spud Chuckers must be 165 ft and Yukon Bolds 180 ft.
 
 Step 6: Assign remaining options
 - From Step 2, if Russets are 180 ft, then hybrid sling must be 135 ft.
 - From Step 3, trebuchet is 150 ft.
 - From Step 4, catapult is 135 ft and slingshot is 165 ft.
 - From Step 5, Spud Chuckers are 165 ft and Yukon Bolds are 180 ft.
 - Flying Eyes must be 135 ft (from Step 1).
 
 Final Answer:
 Fill the following table to show your final answer.
 135 ft | Flying Eyes | catapult
 150 ft | Russets | trebuchet
 165 ft | Spud Chuckers | slingshot
 180 ft | Yukon Bolds | hybrid sling","Step-by-step solution:
1. From Clue 3, the team that reached 135 ft was either the Flying Eyes or used the hybrid sling. This means the Flying Eyes or the hybrid sling must be at 135 ft.

2. From Clue 5, the hybrid sling and the Russets were either at 180 ft or 135 ft. Since we know from Clue 3 that the hybrid sling could be at 135 ft, it's possible that the Russets are at 180 ft.

3. From Clue 1, the trebuchet was used by either the team that reached 150 ft or the Flying Eyes. Since we have the possibility of the Flying Eyes being at 135 ft, the trebuchet must be at 150 ft.

4. From Clue 2, the catapult landed 30 feet short of the slingshot. The only distances that fit this description are 150 ft for the catapult and 180 ft for the slingshot. Since we have already placed the trebuchet at 150 ft, the catapult must be at 135 ft, and the slingshot at 165 ft.

5. From Clue 4, the Spud Chuckers landed somewhat short of the Yukon Bolds. Since the only remaining distances are 150 ft and 165 ft, the Spud Chuckers must be at 150 ft and the Yukon Bolds at 165 ft.

6. Revisiting Clue 5 with the new information, since the Russets are at 180 ft and the hybrid sling is at 135 ft, the Flying Eyes must be at 135 ft using the hybrid sling.

Final Answer:
135 ft | Flying Eyes | hybrid sling
150 ft | Spud Chuckers | trebuchet
165 ft | Yukon Bolds | slingshot
180 ft | Russets | catapult

343.json,"A group of friends has gotten together for dinner, and just for fun they're comparing their ""social networking"" stats on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Using only the clues below, match the facebook to the options from names and linkedin. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

facebook : 120, 130, 140, 150.
names : Danny, Kari, Vickie, Yvonne.
linkedin : 57, 64, 70, 84.

Clues:
1. The person with 84 LinkedIn connections is either the person with 150 Facebook friends or Vickie.
2. Danny has 20  more Facebook friends than Kari.
3. Of the one with 150 Facebook friends and the one with 130 Facebook friends, one is Yvonne and the other has 84 LinkedIn connections.
4. The one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10  more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
120 | correct option from names | correct option from linkedin
130 | correct option from names | correct option from linkedin
140 | correct option from names | correct option from linkedin
150 | correct option from names | correct option from linkedin
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 ""The person with 84 LinkedIn connections is either the person with 150 Facebook friends or Vickie.""
 This means that the person with 84 LinkedIn connections must be linked to either 150 Facebook friends or be Vickie.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
 ""Of the one with 150 Facebook friends and the one with 130 Facebook friends, one is Yvonne and the other has 84 LinkedIn connections.""
 From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we can deduce that the person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections, and the person with 130 Facebook friends is Yvonne.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
 ""Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari.""
 This means Danny and Kari must have consecutive Facebook friend counts from the available options (120, 130, 140, 150). Since 150 is taken by the person with 84 LinkedIn connections and 130 is taken by Yvonne, Danny and Kari must be between 120 and 140. Since Danny has more friends, Danny has 140 and Kari has 120.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 ""The one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections.""
 This means the person with 57 LinkedIn connections must have 130 Facebook friends, but since Yvonne has 130 Facebook friends, this clue must be reinterpreted. The only remaining options for LinkedIn connections are 57 and 70. Since 130 Facebook friends are taken by Yvonne, the next possible pair is 120 and 140. Therefore, the person with 140 Facebook friends has 57 LinkedIn connections, and the person with 120 Facebook friends has 70 LinkedIn connections.
 
 Step 5: Assign Remaining Names and LinkedIn Connections
 From the above deductions:
 - Yvonne has 130 Facebook friends and the remaining LinkedIn option is 64.
 - Vickie, by elimination, has 120 Facebook friends and 70 LinkedIn connections.
 - Danny has 140 Facebook friends and 57 LinkedIn connections.
 - Kari, by elimination, has 150 Facebook friends and 84 LinkedIn connections.
 
 Final Answer:
 120 | Vickie | 70
 130 | Yvonne | 64
 140 | Danny | 57
 150 | Kari | 84","### Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The person with 84 LinkedIn connections is either the person with 150 Facebook friends or Vickie.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Of the one with 150 Facebook friends and the one with 130 Facebook friends, one is Yvonne and the other has 84 LinkedIn connections.
- From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we can deduce that the person with 150 Facebook friends has 84 LinkedIn connections. Therefore, Vickie cannot have 150 Facebook friends and must have a different number of Facebook friends.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**
- Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari.
- Since we know the Facebook friend counts are 120, 130, 140, and 150, Danny and Kari must be one of these pairs: (140, 120) or (150, 130).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- The one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections.
- This means the pairs for Facebook friends with 57 and 70 LinkedIn connections could be (130, 120) or (140, 130).

**Step 5: Combine Clues**
- Since we know from Clue 3 that Yvonne is either 150 or 130 Facebook friends, and from Clue 1 and Clue 3 that 150 Facebook friends have 84 LinkedIn connections, Yvonne must be the one with 150 Facebook friends.
- Therefore, Vickie cannot have 150 Facebook friends and must have 130 Facebook friends with 64 LinkedIn connections (since 84 is taken by Yvonne and 57 and 70 are linked by Clue 4).

**Step 6: Finalize Danny and Kari**
- Since Danny has 20 more Facebook friends than Kari, and Vickie has 130, Danny must have 150 and Kari 130. But since Vickie is already assigned 130, Danny must have 140 and Kari 120.

**Step 7: Assign LinkedIn connections**
- From Clue 4, the one with 57 LinkedIn connections has 10 more Facebook friends than the one with 70 LinkedIn connections. Since Danny has 140 Facebook friends, he must have 57 LinkedIn connections, and Kari with 120 Facebook friends must have 70 LinkedIn connections.

August 22nd | correct option from companies | correct option from positions
August 23rd | correct option from companies | correct option from positions
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 4, the Zathdrill interview is 2 days after the Haytouch interview. This means if Haytouch is on August 20th, Zathdrill would be on August 22nd. If Haytouch is on August 21st, Zathdrill would be on August 23rd.
 
 2. From Clue 1, the Haytouch interview is 2 days before the graphic design position interview. If Haytouch is on August 20th, the graphic design interview would be on August 22nd. If Haytouch is on August 21st, the graphic design interview would be on August 23rd.
 
 3. From Clue 2, either the social media position or the Laneplex interview is on August 23rd, and the other is on August 20th. Since we know from Clue 1 and 4 that Haytouch and Zathdrill occupy August 20th and August 22nd respectively, and graphic design is on August 23rd, Laneplex must be on August 20th and social media on August 23rd.
 
 4. From Clue 3, the janitor position is sometime after the Streeter Inc. interview. Since Streeter Inc. cannot be on August 23rd (as it's occupied by social media), and it cannot be on August 20th (occupied by Laneplex), it must be on August 21st or August 22nd. If Streeter Inc. is on August 21st, the janitor position must be on August 22nd or August 23rd. Since graphic design is on August 23rd, the janitor position must be on August 22nd.
 
 5. Now, we know:
  - August 20th: Laneplex, not yet determined position
  - August 21st: Streeter Inc., not yet determined position
  - August 22nd: Zathdrill, janitor
  - August 23rd: Haytouch, graphic design
 
 6. The remaining position for August 21st must be tech support, as all other positions are accounted for.
 
 Final Answer:
 August 20th | Laneplex | social media
 August 21st | Streeter Inc. | tech support
 August 22nd | Zathdrill | janitor
 August 23rd | Haytouch | graphic design","Step-by-step solution:
1. **Using Clue 4**: The Zathdrill interview is 2 days after the Haytouch interview. This means if Haytouch is on August 20th, Zathdrill must be on August 22nd. If Haytouch is on August 21st, Zathdrill must be on August 23rd.

2. **Using Clue 1**: The Haytouch interview is 2 days before the interview for the graphic design position. If Haytouch is on August 20th, graphic design must be on August 22nd. If Haytouch is on August 21st, graphic design must be on August 23rd.

3. **Combining Clues 1 and 4**: Since Zathdrill and graphic design cannot be on the same day, Haytouch must be on August 20th, Zathdrill on August 22nd, and graphic design on August 23rd.

4. **Using Clue 2**: Of the interview for the social media position and the Laneplex interview, one is on August 23rd and the other is on August 20th. Since graphic design is on August 23rd, Laneplex cannot be on August 23rd. Therefore, Laneplex is on August 20th and social media is on August 23rd.

5. **Using Clue 3**: The meeting for the janitor position is sometime after the Streeter Inc. interview. Since the only days left for Streeter Inc. are August 21st, and the only positions left for August 21st are tech support and janitor, Streeter Inc. must be on August 21st with tech support, and janitor must be on August 22nd.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, the Friambliss was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir. This means the pinot noir cannot be the earliest vintage (1984) since there would be no earlier year for Friambliss.
 
 2. From Clue 2, the 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein. 
 
 3. From Clue 3, the Ece Suss is either the 1992 bottle or the 1996 wine.
 
 4. From Clue 4, of the pinot gris and the 1984 wine, one is the Annata Branco and the other is the Friambliss. This means neither the pinot gris nor the 1984 wine can be the Ece Suss or the Zifennwein.
 
 5. From Clue 5, the Zifennwein was bottled 4 years after the pinot gris. This means the pinot gris must be either 1984 or 1988, and the Zifennwein must be either 1988 or 1992.
 
 6. Since the Zifennwein must be either 1988 or 1992, and the 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein, the Zifennwein cannot be the 1996 wine. Therefore, the 1996 wine must be the syrah.
 
 7. Since the 1996 wine is the syrah, and the Ece Suss is either the 1992 or 1996 wine, the Ece Suss must be the 1992 wine.
 
 8. Since the Ece Suss is the 1992 wine, and the Zifennwein is 4 years after the pinot gris, the pinot gris must be 1988 and the Zifennwein must be 1992.
 
 9. Since the pinot gris is 1988 and one of the pinot gris or the 1984 wine is the Annata Branco, the Annata Branco must be the 1984 wine.
 
 10. Since the Annata Branco is the 1984 wine and the Friambliss is the other option from Clue 4, the Friambliss must be the pinot gris and thus the 1988 wine.
 
 11. Since the Friambliss is the 1988 wine and was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir (Clue 1), the pinot noir must be the 1992 wine.
 
 12. The only remaining vintage is 1996, which we already determined is the syrah, and the only remaining wine is the Zifennwein, which must be the 1992 wine.
 
 Final Answer:
 1984 | Annata Branco | pinot noir
 1988 | Friambliss | pinot gris
 1992 | Ece Suss | gewurztraminer
 1996 | Zifennwein | syrah","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 1**
- The Friambliss was bottled 4 years before the pinot noir. This sets a relationship between the vintages of Friambliss and pinot noir.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 2**
- The 1996 wine is either the syrah or the Zifennwein. This narrows down the options for the 1996 vintage.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The Ece Suss is either the 1992 bottle or the 1996 wine. This gives two possible placements for Ece Suss.

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 4**
- Of the pinot gris and the 1984 wine, one is the Annata Branco and the other is the Friambliss. This clue helps to determine the type of wine for the 1984 vintage and pinot gris.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 5**
- The Zifennwein was bottled 4 years after the pinot gris. This establishes a timeline between Zifennwein and pinot gris.

**Step 6: Deductions and Logical Connections**
- From Clue 5 and Clue 2, if Zifennwein is 1996, then pinot gris must be 1992.
- From Clue 1, if Friambliss is 4 years before pinot noir, and pinot gris is not pinot noir, then pinot noir cannot be 1992. Thus, pinot noir must be 1996, and Friambliss must be 1992.
- From Clue 4, if Friambliss is 1992, then the 1984 wine must be Annata Branco, and pinot gris cannot be 1984. Thus, pinot gris is 1988.
- From Clue 3, if Ece Suss is either 1992 or 1996, and 1992 is Friambliss, then Ece Suss must be 1996.
- From Clue 2, if Ece Suss is 1996, then it must be syrah, and Zifennwein cannot be 1996. Thus, Zifennwein must be 1988.

23 | correct option from fraternities | correct option from streets
26 | correct option from fraternities | correct option from streets
29 | correct option from fraternities | correct option from streets
32 | correct option from fraternities | correct option from streets
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze the clues
 - Clue 1: The fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau.
 - Clue 2: Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or the frat on Aspen Court.
 - Clue 3: Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau.
 - Clue 4: Of Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road, one has 23 members and the other has 29 members.
 
 Step 2: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 1
 - Since Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau, and the fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau, we can set up a relationship:
  Let Alpha Beta Tau = x members,
  Then, Beta Pi Omega = x + 3 members,
  And the fraternity on Boom Court = x - 3 members.
 
 Step 3: Use the member numbers to fit the clues
 - The possible member numbers are 23, 26, 29, and 32.
 - If Alpha Beta Tau = 26 (middle value to allow for both +3 and -3),
  Then, Beta Pi Omega = 29,
  And the fraternity on Boom Court = 23.
 
 Step 4: Apply Clue 2
 - Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or on Aspen Court.
 - Since the fraternity on Boom Court has 23 members, and if we assume Tau Beta Pi = 23 members, then Tau Beta Pi is on Boom Court.
 
 Step 5: Apply Clue 4
 - Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road are either 23 or 29 members.
 - Since Tau Beta Pi (23 members) is on Boom Court, Sigma Beta cannot be 23 members.
 - Therefore, Sigma Beta = 29 members and is on Russell Road.
 
 Step 6: Remaining fraternity and street
 - The remaining fraternity is Alpha Beta Tau with 26 members.
 - The remaining street for Alpha Beta Tau is Norwood Street (since Aspen Court is either Tau Beta Pi or not, and Boom Court and Russell Road are taken).
 
 Step 7: Assign the remaining options
 - Beta Pi Omega = 29 members, and since Sigma Beta is on Russell Road, Beta Pi Omega must be on Aspen Court.
 
 Final Answer:
 23 | Tau Beta Pi | Boom Court
 26 | Alpha Beta Tau | Norwood Street
 29 | Beta Pi Omega | Aspen Court
 32 | Sigma Beta | Russell Road","Step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
- Clue 2 states that Tau Beta Pi is either the house with 23 members or the frat on Aspen Court.
- Clue 4 states that of Sigma Beta and the fraternity on Russell Road, one has 23 members and the other has 29 members.

Step 2: Deduce from Clue 2 and Clue 4
- If Tau Beta Pi has 23 members, it cannot be on Russell Road because Sigma Beta or the fraternity on Russell Road must have 23 or 29 members. Therefore, Tau Beta Pi must be on Aspen Court.

Step 3: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 3
- Clue 1 states that the fraternity on Boom Court has 3 fewer members than Alpha Beta Tau.
- Clue 3 states that Beta Pi Omega has 3 more members than Alpha Beta Tau.

Step 4: Deduce the number of members for Alpha Beta Tau
- Since the members are 23, 26, 29, 32, and Tau Beta Pi is not 23 (it's on Aspen Court), Alpha Beta Tau cannot be 23. If Alpha Beta Tau were 26, then the fraternity on Boom Court would have 23 members (26-3), and Beta Pi Omega would have 29 members (26+3). This fits with the available member numbers and does not conflict with other clues.

Step 5: Assign members to fraternities and streets
- Alpha Beta Tau has 26 members.
- The fraternity on Boom Court (23 members) cannot be Alpha Beta Tau or Beta Pi Omega (since it has 29 members). It must be Sigma Beta based on the elimination of other options.
- Beta Pi Omega has 29 members.
- Tau Beta Pi is on Aspen Court and has 32 members (since 23 is taken by Sigma Beta and 26, 29 are taken by Alpha Beta Tau and Beta Pi Omega).

Step 6: Assign remaining street
- Sigma Beta is on Boom Court.
- Alpha Beta Tau is on Norwood Street (remaining street after assigning Aspen Court to Tau Beta Pi and Boom Court to Sigma Beta).
- Beta Pi Omega is on Russell Road (remaining street).

years : 1525, 1585, 1645, 1705.
shrines : Amari Michi, Matsuno Okura, Takahashi, Yamasaki.
towns : Nakai, Niwa, Uchida, Usui.

Clues:
1. The structure in Niwa is either Amari Michi or Yamasaki.
2. Of Takahashi and the temple in Uchida, one was built in 1525 and the other was built in 1705.
3. Matsuno Okura was built 60 years after the shrine in Nakai.
4. The temple in Nakai was built 60 years after Yamasaki.

Your steps showing how you are solving the puzzle
Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1525 | correct option from shrines | correct option from towns
1585 | correct option from shrines | correct option from towns
1645 | correct option from shrines | correct option from towns
1705 | correct option from shrines | correct option from towns
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
 - The temple in Nakai was built 60 years after Yamasaki. This means Yamasaki must be built 60 years before the temple in Nakai.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
 - Matsuno Okura was built 60 years after the shrine in Nakai. This means Matsuno Okura is built 60 years after the temple in Nakai.
 
 Step 3: Determine the years for Yamasaki, Nakai, and Matsuno Okura
 - Since there are only four years (1525, 1585, 1645, 1705) and Matsuno Okura is built 120 years after Yamasaki (60 years after Nakai which is 60 years after Yamasaki), the only possible sequence that fits is:
  - Yamasaki in 1525
  - Nakai in 1585
  - Matsuno Okura in 1645
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
 - Of Takahashi and the temple in Uchida, one was built in 1525 and the other in 1705. Since Yamasaki is already in 1525, Takahashi or the temple in Uchida must be in 1705. The remaining year for the other is 1705.
 
 Step 5: Assign the remaining shrine and town
 - The only remaining year is 1705, and the only remaining shrine is Takahashi, and the only remaining town is Uchida.
 
 Step 6: Analyze Clue 1
 - The structure in Niwa is either Amari Michi or Yamasaki. Since Yamasaki is already in 1525, Amari Michi must be in Niwa.
 
 Final Answer:
 1525 | Yamasaki | Niwa
 1585 | Amari Michi | Nakai
 1645 | Matsuno Okura | Usui
 1705 | Takahashi | Uchida","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- The temple in Nakai was built 60 years after Yamasaki.
- This establishes a direct timeline between Yamasaki and Nakai.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 3**
- Matsuno Okura was built 60 years after the shrine in Nakai.
- Combining this with Clue 4, Matsuno Okura is 120 years after Yamasaki.

**Step 3: Determine possible years for Yamasaki**
- Since Yamasaki is the earliest among the related shrines, and the years are 1525, 1585, 1645, 1705, Yamasaki cannot be later than 1585 (as 1585 + 120 = 1705, the latest year available).
- If Yamasaki is in 1525, then Nakai (1525 + 60 = 1585) and Matsuno Okura (1585 + 60 = 1645).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of Takahashi and the temple in Uchida, one was built in 1525 and the other in 1705.
- Since Yamasaki is in 1525, Takahashi and Uchida must be 1705 and vice versa. But since we know Matsuno Okura is in 1645, Takahashi must be in 1705 and Uchida in 1525.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 1**
- The structure in Niwa is either Amari Michi or Yamasaki.
- Since Yamasaki is already placed in 1525, Amari Michi must be in Niwa.

**Step 6: Fill in the remaining slots**
- The only remaining year is 1585, which must be for Nakai.
- The only remaining shrine is Amari Michi, which must be in Niwa in 1585.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
1525 | Yamasaki | Uchida
1585 | Nakai | Takahashi

months : March, April, May, June.
dogs : Aries, Hercules, Jaws, Tinkerbell.
officers : Fox, Nolan, Yates, Zimmerman.

Clues:
1. Of the K-9 unit assigned to Officer Yates and the canine that graduated in May, one was Jaws and the other was Hercules.
2. Aries graduated sometime after Jaws.
3. The dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman.
4. The dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell.

Your steps showing how you are solving the puzzle
Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
March | correct option from dogs | correct option from officers
April | correct option from dogs | correct option from officers
May | correct option from dogs | correct option from officers
June | correct option from dogs | correct option from officers
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
 - Of the K-9 unit assigned to Officer Yates and the canine that graduated in May, one was Jaws and the other was Hercules. This means Jaws and Hercules are either assigned to Yates or graduated in May, but not both.
 
 Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
 - Aries graduated sometime after Jaws. This means Jaws cannot be in June, and Aries cannot be in March.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
 - The dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman. This sets a specific sequence with a two-month gap between Nolan's and Zimmerman's dogs.
 
 Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
 - The dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell. This means Tinkerbell cannot be in March, and Fox's dog cannot be in June.
 
 Step 5: Deductions and Assignments
 - Since Jaws and Hercules are linked to Yates and May, and Aries must be after Jaws, Aries cannot be in May. If Jaws were in May, Aries would have to be in June, but that would leave no room for Hercules to be in May or assigned to Yates. Thus, Hercules must be in May.
 - Since Hercules is in May, Yates must be assigned to Jaws (from Clue 1). Jaws cannot be in May, so Jaws must be assigned to Yates in another month.
 - Since Aries is after Jaws and Jaws is linked to Yates, Aries cannot be with Yates. Aries must be in June (the only month left after May for Aries).
 - Since Nolan's dog is 2 months before Zimmerman's, and Tinkerbell is after Fox's dog, Tinkerbell fits best in June, but since Aries is already placed in June, Tinkerbell must be in another month. Thus, Tinkerbell is in April.
 - Nolan's dog must then be in March and Zimmerman's in May. Since Hercules is in May, Zimmerman is assigned to Hercules.
 - The only dog left for March is Jaws, and since Yates is with Jaws, Yates is in March.
 - Fox's dog, being before Tinkerbell and not being Jaws or Hercules, must be Aries in June.
 
 Final Answer:
 March | Jaws | Yates
 April | Tinkerbell | Nolan
 May | Hercules | Zimmerman
 June | Aries | Fox","Step-by-step solution:
- Clue 1 states that Officer Yates is paired with either Jaws or Hercules, and one of them graduated in May. This means Yates is with either Jaws or Hercules, and May is paired with either Jaws or Hercules.
- Clue 2 indicates that Aries graduated sometime after Jaws. This means Jaws cannot be in June, and Aries cannot be in March.
- Clue 3 tells us that the dog assigned to Officer Nolan graduated 2 months before the canine assigned to Officer Zimmerman. This sets a specific order for Nolan and Zimmerman.
- Clue 4 states that the dog assigned to Officer Fox graduated sometime before Tinkerbell. This means Fox cannot be paired with Tinkerbell, and Tinkerbell cannot be in March.

Using these clues, let's start filling the grid:
- Since Jaws and Hercules are linked to Yates and May, and Aries must be after Jaws, Jaws cannot be in May (as Aries would have no month to fit). Therefore, Hercules is in May and Yates is with Hercules.
- Since Jaws is before Aries and cannot be in May, Jaws must be in March or April. Since Aries must be after Jaws, Aries must be in June.
- Since Nolan's dog graduated 2 months before Zimmerman's, and Hercules (May) and Aries (June) are placed, Nolan's dog must be in March and Zimmerman's in May. Therefore, Nolan is with Jaws.
- Since Fox graduates before Tinkerbell and only April and June are left, Fox must be in March or April, and Tinkerbell in June. Since Nolan is already in March, Fox must be in April.
- Zimmerman is with Hercules in May, leaving Yates with Jaws in March.
- The only officer left for June is Yates, but since Yates is with Jaws in March, the officer in June must be Zimmerman. This is a contradiction, so Zimmerman must be in June with Aries, and the remaining officer for May, which is Yates, is already placed. The remaining officer for June is Fox.

Fill the following table to show your final answer.
March | Jaws | Nolan
April | Tinkerbell | Fox

343.json,"MVP Events prides itself on planning large-scale parties for 50 or more people, anywhere in the United States.   This month the company has several different events to plan. Using only the clues below, match the people to the options from planners and events. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

people : 50, 75, 100, 125.
planners : Clarence, Glenda, Mabel, Patrice.
events : conference, graduation, retreat, symposium.

Clues:
1. The symposium event will involve 25 more people than Clarence's assignment.
2. Of the symposium job and the graduation assignment, one will be handled by Mabel and the other will have 125 attendees.
3. The retreat job will involve somewhat fewer people than the graduation job.
4. The assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job.
5. Patrice's assignment will involve 50 more people than the retreat assignment.

While answering use the following format:
Step-by-step solution:
Your steps showing how you are solving the puzzle
Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
50 | correct option from planners | correct option from events
75 | correct option from planners | correct option from events
100 | correct option from planners | correct option from events
125 | correct option from planners | correct option from events
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 2
 - Clue 1 states that the symposium event will involve 25 more people than Clarence's assignment.
 - Clue 2 states that of the symposium job and the graduation assignment, one will be handled by Mabel and the other will have 125 attendees.
 
 Step 2: Deduce from Clue 1 and Clue 2
 - If the symposium has 25 more people than Clarence's assignment, and one of the symposium or graduation has 125 attendees, Clarence cannot be assigned to the symposium (as it would require a negative number of attendees for his assignment). Therefore, Clarence must be assigned to an event with fewer than 125 attendees.
 
 Step 3: Analyze Clue 4 and Clue 5
 - Clue 4 states that the assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job.
 - Clue 5 states that Patrice's assignment will involve 50 more people than the retreat assignment.
 
 Step 4: Deduce from Clue 3 and Clue 5
 - Clue 3 states that the retreat job will involve somewhat fewer people than the graduation job.
 - Since Patrice's assignment involves 50 more people than the retreat, and the retreat has fewer people than the graduation, the retreat cannot have 125 attendees.
 
 Step 5: Assign specific numbers
 - If the symposium has 125 attendees (from Clue 2), and Clarence's assignment has 25 fewer people, Clarence must be assigned to the event with 100 attendees.
 - Since the symposium has 125 attendees and one of the symposium or graduation is handled by Mabel, Mabel must handle the symposium (as Clarence is handling the 100 attendees event).
 
 Step 6: Assign remaining events and people
 - Since the retreat has fewer attendees than the graduation (Clue 3), and the retreat cannot have 125 attendees, the retreat must have 75 attendees.
 - Patrice's assignment, which is 50 more than the retreat, must then be the graduation with 125 attendees.
 - The only remaining number for attendees is 50, which must be the conference.
 
 Step 7: Assign remaining planners
 - Since Mabel is handling the symposium (125 attendees), Clarence is handling the 100 attendees event, and Patrice is handling the graduation (125 attendees), the only remaining planner, Glenda, must handle the conference (50 attendees).
 
 Final Answer:
 50 | Glenda | conference
 75 | Mabel | retreat
 100 | Clarence | symposium
 125 | Patrice | graduation","Step-by-step solution:

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- The assignment with 50 attendees is either Mabel's job or the conference job. This means:
  - 50 | Mabel or Conference

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- Patrice's assignment will involve 50 more people than the retreat assignment. This means the retreat cannot have 125 people because no option exists for 175 people. Also, it cannot have 50 people because then Patrice would have 100, which doesn't fit any other clues directly yet.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The retreat job will involve somewhat fewer people than the graduation job. This means the retreat can't have the highest number of people (125).

**Step 4: Analyze Clue 1**
- The symposium event will involve 25 more people than Clarence's assignment. This means:
  - If Clarence has 100, symposium has 125.
  - If Clarence has 75, symposium has 100.
  - If Clarence has 50, symposium has 75.

**Step 5: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the symposium job and the graduation assignment, one will be handled by Mabel and the other will have 125 attendees. Since symposium can be 75, 100, or 125, and graduation must be more than the retreat, we can start narrowing down:
  - If symposium is 125, then it can't be Mabel's (as per Clue 4, Mabel could be 50). Thus, graduation is Mabel's and must be less than 125 but more than the retreat.

**Step 6: Deductions from Steps**
- Since the retreat must be fewer than graduation and graduation could be Mabel's, let's assign:
  - Retreat can't be 125. If retreat is 75, graduation could be 100 (Mabel's), and symposium 125.
  - This fits as Patrice then would have 125 (50 more than 75).

**Step 7: Final Assignments**
- Clarence can't be 50 (as it's either Mabel's or conference), so Clarence must be 75, making symposium 100.
- This means:
  - 50 | Conference
  - 75 | Clarence | Retreat
  - 100 | Mabel | Graduation
  - 125 | Patrice | Symposium

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

Using only the clues below, match the prices to the options from animals and colors. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

prices : $3.00, $4.00, $5.00, $6.00.
animals : cat, dog, monkey, snail.
colors : gold, orange, red, yellow.

Clues:
1. The monkey cost  more than the gold animal.
2. Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red.
3. The dog cost 1 dollar more than the yellow piece.
4. The snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.
5. The yellow balloon cost 2 dollars less than the red balloon.

$4.00 | correct option from animals | correct option from colors
$5.00 | correct option from animals | correct option from colors
$6.00 | correct option from animals | correct option from colors
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 Step 1: Analyze the clues
 - Clue 4 states that the snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.
 
 Step 2: Use Clue 5
 - The yellow balloon cost $2 less than the red balloon. This means the price difference between the yellow and red balloon is $2.
 
 Step 3: Use Clue 3
 - The dog cost $1 more than the yellow balloon. This helps us link the price of the dog to the yellow balloon.
 
 Step 4: Use Clue 2
 - Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red. This helps us determine the color of the $6.00 balloon and the cat.
 
 Step 5: Use Clue 1
 - The monkey cost more than the gold animal. This helps us determine the relative price of the monkey and the gold-colored balloon.
 
 Step 6: Deduce from Clues
 - Since the snail is either $6.00 or $3.00 (Clue 4), and the yellow balloon is $2 less than the red balloon (Clue 5), we can start assigning prices:
  - If the red balloon is $6.00, then the yellow balloon must be $4.00 (since $6.00 - $2.00 = $4.00).
  - The dog costs $1 more than the yellow balloon (Clue 3), so the dog must be $5.00.
  - The snail, therefore, must be $3.00 since it can only be $6.00 or $3.00 and $6.00 is taken by the red balloon.
 
 Step 7: Assign remaining prices and animals
 - The monkey must be the $6.00 balloon since it costs more than the gold animal (Clue 1) and the only price left higher than $5.00 is $6.00.
 - The cat must then be the $4.00 balloon.
 
 Step 8: Assign colors
 - The $6.00 balloon is red (from Clue 2 and Step 6).
 - The yellow balloon is $4.00, so the cat is yellow.
 - The dog is $5.00, and the only color left for it is gold (since the monkey is more expensive than the gold animal, it can't be gold).
 - The snail is $3.00, and the only color left is orange.
 
 Final Answer:
 $3.00 | snail | orange
 $4.00 | cat | yellow
 $5.00 | dog | gold
 $6.00 | monkey | red","**Step-by-step solution:**

**Step 1: Analyze Clue 4**
- The snail was either the $6.00 balloon or the $3.00 balloon.

**Step 2: Analyze Clue 5**
- The yellow balloon cost 2 dollars less than the red balloon.
  - This means the yellow balloon cannot be the most expensive ($6.00) or the least expensive ($3.00), as it needs a price exactly $2 higher available for the red balloon.

**Step 3: Analyze Clue 3**
- The dog cost 1 dollar more than the yellow piece.
  - Since the yellow balloon cannot be $3.00 (as it needs a price $1 higher for the dog), and it cannot be $6.00 (as it needs to be $2 less than the red balloon), the yellow balloon must be $4.00, making the dog $5.00.

**Step 4: Revisit Clue 5 with new information**
- Since the yellow balloon is $4.00, the red balloon must be $6.00.

**Step 5: Revisit Clue 4 with new information**
- Since the red balloon is $6.00, the snail must be the $3.00 balloon (as it can't be $6.00).

**Step 6: Analyze Clue 1**
- The monkey cost more than the gold animal.
  - Since the snail is $3.00 and not gold, and the dog is $5.00, the monkey must be $6.00 (as it costs more than any other option).

**Step 7: Analyze Clue 2**
- Of the cat and the $6.00 balloon, one was orange and the other was red.
  - Since the $6.00 balloon is the monkey and is red, the cat must be orange.

**Step 8: Fill in remaining details**
- The only remaining animal is the cat, and the only remaining color for the $4.00 price is orange.

**Final Answer:**
Fill the following table to show your final answer.

","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 2, Velma Vintz's book costs $10 less than Tara Tyne's book. This means that if Velma's book is $24.99, Tara's must be $34.99; if Velma's is $29.99, Tara's must be $39.99.
 
 2. From Clue 1, the calculus book costs $5 more than Velma Vintz's book. If Velma's book is $24.99, calculus would be $29.99; if Velma's book is $29.99, calculus would be $34.99.
 
 3. From Clue 5, the pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99. Since Tara Tyne's book could be $34.99 or $39.99, and the pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99, Tara cannot have written the pre-calculus book.
 
 4. From Clue 4, either the algebra book or the $39.99 book was written by Pat Peterson or Tara Tyne. Since Tara's book could be $34.99 or $39.99, and the pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99, Tara must have written the $39.99 book, which is not pre-calculus. Therefore, Tara wrote the algebra book, and it costs $39.99.
 
 5. Since Tara wrote the algebra book at $39.99, the pre-calculus book must be $24.99. This leaves $29.99 and $34.99 for calculus and field theory.
 
 6. From Clue 3, the field theory book costs more than Mina Morton's book. Since calculus is $5 more than Velma's book, and Velma's book is either $24.99 or $29.99, calculus must be $29.99 or $34.99. If calculus is $29.99, Velma's book is $24.99, and Mina's book must be less than the field theory book, which would then be $34.99.
 
 7. This setup means Velma's book is $24.99, calculus is $29.99, field theory is $34.99, and algebra is $39.99. Mina Morton's book must be the field theory book at $34.99, as it is the only one left that fits the price pattern.
 
 Final Answer:
 $24.99 | pre-calculus | Velma Vintz
 $29.99 | calculus | Pat Peterson
 $34.99 | field theory | Mina Morton
 $39.99 | algebra | Tara Tyne","Step-by-step solution:
1. **Establishing Relationships from Clues:**
   - **Clue 2:** Velma Vintz's book costs $10 less than Tara Tyne's book.
   - **Clue 1:** The calculus book costs $5 more than Velma Vintz's book.

   Using these clues, we can establish a price relationship between Velma and Tara, and between Velma and the calculus book.

2. **Assigning Initial Prices:**
   - Let's assume Velma's book is priced at $29.99. According to Clue 2, Tara's book would then be $39.99.
   - According to Clue 1, the calculus book, costing $5 more than Velma's book, would be $34.99.

3. **Further Price Assignments:**
   - **Clue 5:** The pre-calculus book is either $39.99 or $24.99. Since Tara's book at $39.99 is calculus, pre-calculus must be $24.99.
   - **Clue 3:** The field theory book costs more than Mina Morton's book. Since the only prices higher than $24.99 are $29.99, $34.99, and $39.99, and calculus is $34.99, field theory must be $29.99.

4. **Author Assignments:**
   - **Clue 4:** The algebra book and the $39.99 title are either by Pat Peterson or Tara Tyne. Since Tara wrote the calculus book priced at $39.99, Pat Peterson must have written the algebra book.
   - Since calculus is $34.99 and field theory is $29.99, algebra must be the remaining price, which is $29.99.

5. **Finalizing the Table:**
   - Mina Morton's book is pre-calculus priced at $24.99.
   - Pat Peterson's book is algebra priced at $29.99.
   - Velma Vintz's book is field theory priced at $34.99.
   - Tara Tyne's book is calculus priced at $39.99.

Final Answer:

343.json,"Drissel's Tortoise Farm is a refuge for tortoises from all over the world, many of which can live to be well over 100 years of age. Using only the clues below, match the ages to the options from tortoises and species. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.

ages : 14, 32, 50, 68.
tortoises : Chewie, Methuselah, Shelly, Yoda.
species : black neck, horned, pitch belly, two rimmed.

Clues:
1. Methuselah is 32 years old.
2. The two rimmed tortoise is 36 years older than the horned tortoise.
3. Chewie is either the pitch belly tortoise or the 50-year-old one.
4. Of the black neck tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise, one is 68 years old and the other is named Shelly.

Final Answer:
Fill the following table to show your final answer.
14 | correct option from tortoises | correct option from species
32 | correct option from tortoises | correct option from species
50 | correct option from tortoises | correct option from species
68 | correct option from tortoises | correct option from species
","Step-by-step solution:
 
 1. From Clue 1, Methuselah is 32 years old. We can fill this in the table.
  32 | Methuselah | -
 
 2. Clue 2 states that the two rimmed tortoise is 36 years older than the horned tortoise. Since the ages available are 14, 32, 50, and 68, and the difference must be 36 years, the only possible ages for these tortoises are 14 (horned) and 50 (two rimmed) or 32 (horned) and 68 (two rimmed). Since Methuselah is already 32 and not a two rimmed tortoise, the horned tortoise must be 14 and the two rimmed tortoise must be 50.
  14 | - | horned
  50 | - | two rimmed
 
 3. Clue 3 states that Chewie is either the pitch belly tortoise or the 50-year-old one. Since the 50-year-old tortoise is the two rimmed tortoise, Chewie must be the pitch belly tortoise.
  - | Chewie | pitch belly
 
 4. Clue 4 states that of the black neck tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise, one is 68 years old and the other is named Shelly. Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, the black neck tortoise must be 68 years old and Shelly must be the name of the two rimmed tortoise.
  68 | - | black neck
  50 | Shelly | two rimmed
 
 5. Now, we know:
  - Methuselah is 32 and not assigned a species.
  - Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise.
  - Shelly is 50 years old and the two rimmed tortoise.
  - The black neck tortoise is 68 years old.
  - The horned tortoise is 14 years old.
 
  Since Methuselah is 32 and not assigned a species, and the only species left is the horned tortoise, Methuselah must be the horned tortoise.
  32 | Methuselah | horned
 
 6. The only tortoise and age left unassigned are Yoda and 14. So, Yoda is 14 years old.
  14 | Yoda | -
 
 7. The only species left for Yoda is pitch belly, but Chewie is already the pitch belly tortoise. Since Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise, Yoda must be the black neck tortoise, and the 68-year-old tortoise must be the pitch belly tortoise. This corrects the earlier assumption.
  68 | - | pitch belly
  14 | Yoda | black neck
 
 8. The only tortoise left for 68 years old is Chewie.
  68 | Chewie | pitch belly
 
 Final Answer:
 14 | Yoda | black neck
 32 | Methuselah | horned
 50 | Shelly | two rimmed
 68 | Chewie | pitch belly","Step-by-step solution:
1. **Using Clue 1**: Methuselah is 32 years old. This is a direct placement.
2. **Using Clue 2**: The two rimmed tortoise is 36 years older than the horned tortoise. The possible ages for the tortoises are 14, 32, 50, and 68. Since Methuselah is 32 and not related to these species by the clues, the horned tortoise must be 14 and the two rimmed tortoise must be 50.
3. **Using Clue 3**: Chewie is either the pitch belly tortoise or the 50-year-old one. Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, Chewie cannot be 50 years old, so Chewie must be the pitch belly tortoise.
4. **Using Clue 4**: Of the black neck tortoise and the two rimmed tortoise, one is 68 years old and the other is named Shelly. Since the two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old, Shelly must be the two rimmed tortoise. Therefore, the black neck tortoise must be 68 years old.
5. **Assigning Remaining Names and Species**:
   - Methuselah is already determined as 32 years old.
   - The horned tortoise is 14 years old.
   - The two rimmed tortoise is 50 years old and named Shelly.
   - The black neck tortoise is 68 years old.
   - Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise.
   - The remaining tortoise, Yoda, must be the horned tortoise and 14 years old.
   - Since Chewie is the pitch belly tortoise and not 50 years old, Chewie must be 68 years old.
   - The remaining age, 68, must be associated with the black neck tortoise, which we already determined.
   - Since all other species are assigned, Methuselah must be the remaining species, which is black neck.

Final Answer:
14 | Yoda | horned
32 | Methuselah | black neck
50 | Shelly | two rimmed
68 | Chewie | pitch belly
